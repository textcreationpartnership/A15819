            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But alas, the <hi>faſhion</hi> of this world is changed, and all is become <hi>complement;</hi> hee is no compleat <hi>Gentleman,</hi> that cannot be as humble as the <hi>toe;</hi> as <hi>plaine,</hi> as if he meant to open all his heart; and as <hi>modeſt,</hi> as though hee had learned a whole yeare to compoſe his geſture: but <hi>nature</hi> forced, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies moſt vnruly; and the face that hath moſt fluſhings of heat, hath the coldeſt heart; and burnings without, are coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers within. <hi>Maskes</hi> once ſerued for ſporting, but I feare them now to bee vſed in good earneſt: <hi>painting</hi> was but a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb facs="tcp:21235:3"/>but now it's the beſt ſubſtance: yet let me tell this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered age, that painting is meeter for <hi>ragged walls,</hi> then fine marble; for an unruly <hi>Iezebel,</hi> then a chaſt matron: in a word, all ſtrange complements, they are no better then court holy water, or a Popes bleſſing; and I am ſure, where hee bleſſeth, God curſeth. The earth is full of faire <hi>words,</hi> but they pay no <hi>debts,</hi> neither is any man the richer for them. And I would to God the faſhion had reſted in the bodie; but woe is me, it is crept into the ſoule, and makes all learning but a flouriſh: Therefore I thought it (right Worſh.) verie good to abſtaine from the faſhion, becauſe in all kinds, we may finde them by experience to he but a daies wearing: The <hi>Taylors</hi> care is ouer, if he hit the cut; the <hi>Shooemaker,</hi> if his ſhooe hold the pulling on: and euery tradeſ-man thinkes his ſhop then beſt furniſhed, when his wares wil ſerue the time: but for my part, I know not how to cut out the truth, better then by <hi>plainneſſe;</hi> to plucke it on, then by <hi>modeſtie;</hi> and make it ſerue the time, then by <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</hi> I care for no more, if ſo be I may but be a friend of the bridegroome, to wooe his ſpouſe; or as one of his eunuches to trimme her for himſelfe: neither euer did I intend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat for welcome by flatterie, which is alwaies intertained as long as ſelfe-loue is at home: and to what purpoſe ſhould I be more curious? I am ſure that the painting of windowes ſtops the light, and that plainer <hi>glaſſe,</hi> would permit the ſunne a clearer entrance: a <hi>black ground</hi> beſt beſeemes a <hi>white counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit;</hi> and a faire <hi>countenance</hi> needs no varniſh: where the wine is neate, there needeth no ivy-buſh; neither the right <hi>corall</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny colouring: So where the <hi>truth</hi> it ſelfe bringeth credit, the man with his gloſſe, winneth ſmall commendation: where the matter is of ſufficient excellencie, there is more ſhew of a preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant wit, then perfect wiſedome to vſe ſuperfluous eloquence: the naked tale moſt ſets forth the naked truth, and the plaineſt ſtyle, is the ſooneſt vnderſtood. I do not condemn eloquence or humane learning in diuine myſteries; it is lawful, I confeſſe, for the Iſraelites to take <hi>iewels, gold, ſiluer,</hi> and other precious <hi>ornaments;</hi> but let them take heede how they vſe them, leaſt they make a <hi>calfe,</hi> and then they looſe their beautie, hauing
<pb facs="tcp:21235:3"/>loſt their true ſeruice. Neither would I be ſo curious in trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vp of the truth, as though my greateſt care ſhould be for the habit of words: for I know that skilfull <hi>Apelles,</hi> coueting to mend the <hi>noſe,</hi> marred the <hi>cheeke;</hi> and often the fooliſh dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is not content with the die of his cloth, vntill he haue bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it. I know the <hi>word of God</hi> hath been ſufficiently tryed to my hands, and the holy Ghoſt hath giuen it a ſufficient tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of beautie. Indeede, in nature there is no <hi>tree,</hi> but hath ſome blaſt; no <hi>countenance,</hi> but hath ſome blemiſh; the faireſt <hi>leopard</hi> is not without his ſpots; the fineſt cloth is made with his liſt, and the ſmootheſt <hi>ſhooe</hi> with his laſte: But the word of God is a <hi>tree of life</hi> that is neuer blaſted, a <hi>glaſſe</hi> that doth neuer ſhew vs a blemiſhed countenance, a <hi>ſtore-houſe</hi> of all garments to be worne without liſt or ſeame; and as ſtrong as a leopard, without any ſpot or blemiſh; a goſpel of peace, prepared with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any wooden laſte of humane eloquence, and yet ſits as cloſe to the feete of the ſoule, as heart can wiſh. Neither doe I ſpeake this to excuſe my ſelfe; for I might well learne wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from the <hi>Estrich,</hi> that though ſhe taketh greateſt pride in her feathers, yet is content to picke ſome of the worſt out, and burne them: ſo might I picke out many things and purge them in the fire. <hi>Alexander</hi> laid his ſinger on his cheeke, leaſt <hi>Apelles</hi> ſhould paint his skarre: but it is my mind to hold my finger off my skarres, leaſt ſome skilfull <hi>Apelles</hi> paint the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, not couering but pointing at the skarre; and ſo lay open as much hypocriſie in the writer, as blemiſhes in the writing. Therefore (right Worſh.) ſeeing I am to vndergoe cenſure, and bee brought before euerie mans iudgement ſeat, I haue great cauſe to ſeek out my <hi>aduocate</hi> and patron: <hi>Iudicem aditu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus? patronum quare;</hi> muſt you before a Iudge? ſeeke out your patron. In duty and loue I could ſeeke none beſide your ſelfe, &amp; my confidence of your acceptation is ſo ſtrong, that I feare not the leaſt deniall: you gaue me the firſt entertainement that euer I had abroad, and therefore in reaſon I could not but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you with the firſt fruits of my labours. I doubt not but that your ſelfe doth both ſee and bewaile the miſerie of theſe wretched times, in which <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> and <hi>Policie</hi> (falſly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb facs="tcp:21235:4"/>beeing indeed little better then plaine villanie) and <hi>Tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizing,</hi> haue like a canker, fretted out the verie heart of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Few there are that ſeeke for eſtabliſhed hearts, and to know preciſely whether <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Baal</hi> bee the true God: and for reſolution, they reſolue that the beſt courſe is to <hi>halt betweene two opinions,</hi> that ſo all times might ſerue their turnes. But <hi>you haue not ſo learned Chriſt:</hi> for this can I teſtifie of your paine &amp; diligence, that you labour for nothing more, then the gaining of <hi>aduiſed reſolution.</hi> If I ſhould ſay all that I know, the world would cenſure me of flattery: and if I knewe that ſelfe-loue were at home with your ſelfe, then ſhould I neuer feare want of intertainment in learning to diſſemble: but both the world, and your ſelfe muſt pardon my boldneſſe; for I ſpeake not to blaze abroad your praiſe, but to intreat that kindneſſe, that men would admit of your <hi>example,</hi> as a <hi>patterne for imitation.</hi> Three things conſtraine mee to vtter my mind: Firſt, that continuall care which you haue for reſolution of many difficulties in <hi>diuinity:</hi> the means which you haue vſed are but practiſed of few: one is, that you haue not bin content to take your reſolution of diuine truth from <hi>tranſlations;</hi> but haue taken that paines, that you are able to fetch it from the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall,</hi> and drinke of the pureſt fountaine: A ſecond meanes is, that of the Philoſopher, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to make que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of matters of <hi>religion,</hi> whenſoeuer you haue ſeene iuſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie, and fit perſons to reſolue; neither haue you been content to admit of <hi>ſuperficiall anſwers,</hi> but haue preſſed <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> vpon them to ſee the true tryall; and often your own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions haue bin more agreeable with the truth and <hi>context of Sciptures,</hi> then that which others haue ſaid: let this teach men of your place, beſides their continuall imploiments, to ſet ſome time apart, for this excellent knowledge of the <hi>originalls of the Bible,</hi> and knowledge of that art. A ſecond good example is, your continual care that the <hi>legges of iuſtice</hi> may not lie broken in the <hi>ſtreets,</hi> and no man to raiſe it vp: A happie thing when men of place count their dignities to be conferred, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good for <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> Thirdly, for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>election,</hi> this you onely haue not affirmed by word, but
<pb facs="tcp:21235:4"/>performed by action, that the place, more then the perſon, might haue cauſe to reioyce. For my ſelfe, I confeſſe I had no cauſe to be i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a common ſaying, that an <hi>Exorciſt</hi> may ſooner <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure</hi> vp a <hi>logion of deuills,</hi> then <hi>adiure</hi> one of them out of his habitation: And as it is with bodily <hi>poſſeſſion,</hi> ſo is it with the <hi>obſeſſion</hi> of the ſoule: for although the deuill cannot pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate the <hi>ſoules dimenſions,</hi> yet he will ſit ſo neere it, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer admits him the leaſt good fellowſhippe, he ſhall not be freed of his company, when he is wearie, and with all his heart would ſhake hands with him. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> challenge all our Churches as falſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we can caſt out no deuills; but the whole world knowes that they can doe it to the <hi>admiration of thouſands:</hi> but for my part, I knowe not how they coniure the deuill from the bodie; yet this I dare boldly affirme, that where they haue gotten one deuill out of mens bodies, they haue admitted a thouſand into mens ſoules: and ſurely, the deuill were a foole, if he would not change his roome for a better lodging: I am ſure, that there was neuer any church that hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured vp more <hi>hereſies</hi> then they haue done; and as yet I know not one that they haue adiured, and ſent packing into hell. No marueile that they haue need of ſtrange <hi>exorciſmes,</hi> for otherwiſe how ſhould men be confirmed in their ſtrange doctrines? theſe queſtionleſſe haue bin <hi>ſtrong deluſions to make them beleeue lies.</hi> But if they pleaſe to admit of the holy Scriptures, we ſhall at the firſt reſolue them of a double meanes: <hi>Math. 17.20.21.</hi> the firſt is miraculous, and for a time: the ſecond ordinarie, and ſo remaines in the Church: the one is in the <hi>20. v.</hi> the other in the <hi>21.</hi> and this ſecond meanes we haue: I am ſure the Church of God may <hi>pray</hi> and <hi>faſt,</hi> to deliuer both bodie and ſoule from the deuil. But perhaps they will ſay, ſhew vs whom you haue diſpoſſeſſed? I anſwer, Prayer &amp; faſting are of the ſame nature that preaching and adminiſtring the ſacraments: they being conſcionably vſed, worke where and whenſoeuer God pleaſeth.
<pb facs="tcp:21235:5"/>I doubt not but by the preaching of the word, thouſands haue bin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted vnto the faith: and where men get the deuil out of the ſoule, he will haue ſmall hope or comfort, either to enter or ſtay in the body: and ſo, no maruell the deuill holds them ſo ſtrongly, and takes ſuch good liking of them, that he will be at their commaund, to leaue the body, and aſcend into an higher roome: for he is proud enough to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain ſuch a motion. And though I deny not but we haue had ſome poſſeſſed among vs, yet I dare boldly ſay, the moſt haue bin of their owne making: Let them take the credit of their art, for queſtionles, a blacke art beſt beſeemes a religion of darkneſſe, blindneſſe, and ignorance.</p>
            <p>But to applie our Sauiours rule vnto our purpoſe: <hi>Faſting</hi> and <hi>praier</hi> are admirable meanes in the Church of God; not onely to caſt out deuills and vncleane ſpirits; but alſo to fill the ſoule with the <hi>ſpirit of grace, and goodnes.</hi> And here I tremble to ſpeake, and charge mine owne heart with exceeding great negligence, as often as I call to remembrance, the extraordinarie faſting and prayer of <hi>Arminius;</hi> eſpecially whenſoeuer he entred this <hi>myſterie of myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Gods eternal predeſtination:</hi> A point that hath troubled the Church of God, more then euer the deuill vexed that young man in the Goſpel. This hath made many no better then <hi>lunaticke,</hi> caſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers into the <hi>fire of contention,</hi> and drowned numbers in the <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of euerlaſting perdition.</hi> Now alas, what good ſoule would not downe on his knees, cry with all his heart, <hi>Lord Ieſus take pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> on this deſtreſſed world, reſtore them to their <hi>ſenſes,</hi> deliuer them from theſe <hi>fierce fiers,</hi> and pul them out of theſe <hi>dangerous waters:</hi> often hath it bin in the hands of thy Paſtours, but as yet they could not heale vp theſe brawles: ſurely it is, becauſe we are a <hi>faithleſſe</hi> and <hi>crooked generation:</hi> Long haſt thou been with vs, and we haue had a large time of thy patience, and it could not be but that thou would haue brought it to paſſe long before this, except our vnbeleife had hindred it. <hi>Arminius</hi> hath taken in hand to worke this cure, but I feare he hath raiſed vp more <hi>ſpirits,</hi> then can eaſily be laid againe. Queſtionleſſe, as our <hi>Sauiour Chriſt</hi> ſpoke of that kind of poſſeſſion, that it could not come out but by prayer and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting: ſo no more can theſe <hi>dangerous ſpirits of error</hi> be quieted
<pb facs="tcp:21235:6"/>and laid to ſleepe, but by the prayers and faſtings of Gods faithfull people. <hi>Iſa. 58.3.</hi> condemnes all faſting to <hi>ſeeke our owne wills,</hi> and <hi>require our owne debts:</hi> it cannot be good <hi>to faſt for ſtrife,</hi> and <hi>to ſmite with the hand of wickedneſſe.</hi> Surely I haue heard, that when <hi>Arminius</hi> was intreated to defend the receiued opinion of Predeſtination in the reformed Churches, did ſo diſtaſt it, that hee broached in his readings the cleane contrarie, whereupon ſtrange rumours were raiſed, that he was become a maine hereticke. It was <hi>Bezas iudgement</hi> of him, when hee was a young man, that hee would either prooue an admirable miniſter of God, or a dangerous enemie to Gods truth: Theſe reports are not to be paſſed ouer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſideration; for though he ſeeme to cry downe the <hi>former ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi> in a booke now extant: yet both the booke, and the rumours together, demonſtrate that he ſought an oppoſite wil to the reformed Churches. We denie not but that Gods true Church may erre, and ſo his will might not be againſt Gods will: yet for my part, I eſteeme ſo reuerently of my <hi>auncients,</hi> and the <hi>truth admitted, defended,</hi> and <hi>propagated</hi> by them, that I dare not otherwiſe iudge, then that <hi>Arminius</hi> in faſting and prayer, ſought his owne will: and therefore no maruell if he haue laboured to ſtriue with that worthy man <hi>M. Perkins.</hi> In the beginning of his booke, he profeſſeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but brotherly loue: yet I intreat you, obſerue but the whole carriage of his booke, and ſee how he ſcannes euery word, exults &amp; triumphs ouer him, as though he meant to cenſure him for a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous hereticke againſt God. The man is dead, his booke is now his memoriall: and to my reading ſauours of nothing more, but that he meant to ſmite this worthie man, if not <hi>with the fiſt of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> yet of <hi>hard cenſure</hi> and iudgement. This likewiſe may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in his <hi>followers,</hi> who beare a moſt deadly hatred to all that profeſſe M. <hi>Calvin,</hi> and his beſt followers; and moſt ſhamefully rayle on them: the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſhall find more loue at their hands, then a <hi>Caluiniſt.</hi> Alas, my brethren; <hi>is this the faſt that the Lord hath choſen?</hi> No, no: the Lord would haue vs <hi>looſe the bands of wickedneſſe, take off the heauie burdens of ſinne,</hi> and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, <hi>deale the bread of life to the hungrie, bring the poore that wander into Gods houſe, &amp; not hide our ſelues from our own fleſh:</hi> If wee would conſider this, then would the Lord <hi>make our
<pb facs="tcp:21235:6"/>light breake forth as the morning, our health growe ſpeedily, righteouſneſſe goe before vs, and the whole glorie of the Lord embrace vs.</hi> The want of this, makes the Papiſts reioyce, and triumph to ſee vs, their profeſſed enemies, to quarrell and ſtrike at one another. Oh that I had a <hi>bodie</hi> to <hi>faſt</hi> night and day! and a <hi>heart to pray</hi> that the Lord would reconcile vs, and make his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous truth ſhine among vs, to expell that darkneſſe that makes the diuiſion! When my booke was in the preſſe, I intended nothing but the meere explaining of Gods ordering of ſinne, and ſo make vſe of it: but I could not in my minde be at reſt, vntill I had attempted ſome thing, in this maine controverſie. I acknowledge it might haue bin much better atcheiued by ſome of the <hi>Lords great Worthies,</hi> vnto the leaſt degree of whoſe ſtrength, I haue not attained: But being as yet neglected by them, I thought it better, notwithſtanding my great weaknes, to ſay ſomething in the loue of the truth, then to paſſe it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer with ſilence. I hope it will put others in mind who are of greater abilitie, what they ought to doe: and I would to God my labours might ſerue as <hi>foyles,</hi> to ſhew the greater glory of their ſurpaſſing excellencies: or as <hi>courſer wares,</hi> to make their <hi>finer ſtuffes</hi> more ſaleable and commendable. For mine owne part, I am ſo reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, that I put it in my creed, as an error that I will neuer beleeue; and I hope in God it is now at his height. Chriſtian Reader, be not offended with my young yeares, to make thee diſtaſt my timely wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. I hope I haue keept me to Gods truth; eſteeme that, and then iudge mee as thou pleaſeſt. <hi>Conſider what is ſaid, and the Lord giue vs vnderſtanding in all things.</hi>

               <p>This Pſalme is as I may tearme it, an Aſſize or ſeſſion hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the Lord: vnto whoſe iudgment ſeat are called his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ones, ſuch as feare him in ſinceritie of heart; and hypocrits, ſuch as feare him in ſhewe, whoſe lips call vpon him, but their hearts are far eſtranged from him: therefore that we may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably behaue our ſelues in this matter, &amp; ſet our ſelues to the true conſideration of the forme &amp; manner of proceeding, let vs giue the ſumme of the whole Pſalme in a plaine &amp; orderly analyſis of the whole matter: and the rather I take it in hand, becauſe that if I ſhall vnderſtand the Church of God to reape benefit by it, I ſhall proceed in the reſt of my purpoſes ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this way: for this I haue purpoſed to doe by the grace of God, and the aſſiſtance of his ſpirit. Firſt, to ſhew the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable eſtate of Gods Church, in outward things. Secondly, to diſcouer the lights of Prophecie, which haue made theſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21235:10"/>diuers colours apparent, leaſt through our corruption wee ſhould aſcribe all to fortune. Thirdly, Due performance of his promiſes, in making all things worke together for the good of his Church and children: whereby all doubts that might ſpring out of the two former, are fully reſolued, and God prooued moſt wiſe in diſpoſing of all things, and moſt true in foretelling of all future accidents. Fourthly, Becauſe the moſt liuely colour of Gods Church in this world, is afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to laie down a diſcourſe of that, whereby euery faithful ſoule may ſee, what dammage it is to the profeſſion of Chriſt. Fiftly, Becauſe affliction is the worſt eſtate of Gods Church, I will ſhew that it is a more happie eſtate, then the beſt eſtate in the world. Sixtly, To drawe men from the confidence of the world, and from that vaine conceite of religion, as the diſcontentedſt life in the world, I will plainely ſhew, that the world and all the excellencie of it, can not giue a man content in all his wants, ioy in all his ſorrowes, neither to reach vnto eternitie: and therefore men ſhall find the iſſue thereof, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but vanitie, and vexation of ſpirit: and that their onely happineſſe conſiſts in the feare of God, and keeping of his commandements. Seuenthly, To take away all Balams wiſhes, and the perſwaſion of hypocrites, wee will ſhewe what the Lord requires for the attaining of true happineſſe. Eightly, Wee will lay downe the true triall of our eſtates, leaſt with hypocrites we build the ſpiders houſe, and ſo be ſwept down with the beſome of Gods wrath, &amp; with hypocrites throwne downe into hell. Ninthly, Wee will laie downe Gods admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition to all whoſe caſe is not deſperate, that they looke to themſelues, whileſt the gracious call of the day of the Lords viſitation is vpon them, that they be reclaimed. Laſtly, wee will ſhew the comfortable invitation of the Lord, to euery one that is hungry and thirſtie for the bread and water of life. Wherewith wee wil ioyne Gods awaking of euery ſleeper to ſtand vp from the dead, that Chriſt may giue him light. And becauſe many deceiue themſelues, this ſhall be the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that after the light hath appeared, how they ought to walke vntil the day ſtarre of righteouſneſſe hath guided them
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21235:10"/>to the place of all bliſſe and happineſſe. Theſe things haue ſo inflamed my heart, that I would faine haue the fire break out: and yet my yeeres make mee with Elihu, to ſay, I am yong in yeeres, and many about mee are ancient: Therefore hitherto haue I doubted, and ſtill am afraid to ſhew mine opinion: for it beſeemes youth to ſay, the dayes ſhall ſpeake, and the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of yeeres ſhall teach wiſedome: neither (bleſſed be God) need I to ſpeake, becauſe I haue waited till the ancient haue ſpoken, and yet perceiue that they haue found out no matter to comfort good Chriſtians, and condemne the world, for the world is full of their learned writings, and they haue brought ſufficient teſtimonies to prooue all truths, convince all errors, eſtabliſh the godly, and throw downe the wicked and profane: yet ſeeing God will haue line vpon line, and precept vpon precept, I haue beene bold to doe ſomething, for the building vp of Gods ſanctuarie. Surely, there is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in man, but the inſpiration of the Almightie giueth vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Therefore renouncing my owne ſpirit, and deſiring wiſedome from the true fountaine, I truſt in God I ſhall not ſpeake out of my turne, nor ſhew mine opinion in an vnſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable time: for I confeſſe God hath made mee full of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the ſpirit within mee compelleth me, behold my bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie is as the wine which hath no vent, and like the new bottels that braſt, therefore will I ſpeake that I may take breath, I wil open my lippes, that ſo I may be caſed of my trauel. And God grant that when I haue deliuered my hearts deſire, I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce that God thereby is glorified, his Church edified, poore Chriſtians comforted, and my owne ſoule ſaued; when I ſhall come to giue vp my accounts to my God, that beſtowed his talents vpon mee, to trade withall vnto his comming: and therefore in confidence that God wil accept of my poore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and that it ſhall not be in vaine, I offer this as a pledge of the reſt.</p>
               <p>But to returne againe to our former ſubiect, the partes of this Pſalme are in number two: The comming of the Iudge, and his order of proceeding: the comming of the iudge to the ſeauenth verſe; his proceeding in iudgement in the reſt.

And the manner of his commanding is forcible, for it is but ſpeaking and calling, and at his word hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth obey. 2.

Marke therefore how the Lord proceeds with his Saints by way of reformation, which is double: firſt, correction of their error. 2. direction of them in the truth. Correction of error to the 14. v. direction in the truth, 14, 15. In the correction of their error, there is a moſt exquiſite methode obſerued by the Lord, which may be a patterne for all Chriſtians to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21235:12"/>and that is this, firſt to manifeſt his loue, v. 7. 2. to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt their error, v. 8. which muſt needs be very ſeaſonable after the former: 3. to take away the occaſion of their error, which muſt needs be profitable to ouerturne the ſecond: 4. And to giue reaſons of the remoouall, which muſt needs take away all cauill and fond oppoſitions of our vntoward natures, v. 10, 11, 12, 13. Let vs looke vpon them all: firſt the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his loue, v. 7. Firſt, a kind compellation, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing invitation to attention, in this word <hi>(heare:)</hi> if a man were ſicke in his bodie, hee would be very deſirous that the Phyſitian would neuer make an end of ſpeaking, and therfore if wee had the ſame wiſedome for our ſoules, how attentiue ſhould wee be when ſo excellent a Phyſitian as the Lord ſhal ſpeake. 2. From the relation that is betwixt God and them: a graceleſſe child that will not heare his father before all men in the world; <hi>O my people, oh Iſrael:</hi> euery word an argument, <hi>(people)</hi> therefore if all people ſhall bow downe, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Lord, then is it their dutie not to exclude themſelues. 2.

Iſrael there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is a ſtrong bond, firſt becauſe it points out vnto them the couenant that was made with Abraham Iſaac and Iaacob: 2. the power they ſhould haue with God, and from God, to preuaile with all power euen of hel, death, and damnation: 4.

Reaſon to perſwade, is drawne from the beſt teſtimonie in the world; I will ſpeake, I will teſtifie; and therfore ſhall not Gods people heare, when the Lord of hoſts ſhall ſpeake? and ſhall they not beleeue, when the moſt faithfull witneſſe ſhal teſtifie vnto them? ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it were intollerable, if God ſhould not haue the hearing with all reuerence. 4.

The parts of his worſhip, are prayer and prayſe; praiſe in the 14. ver. deſcribed, firſt by his parts, to offer and pay: the firſt ſhewes the willingnes of the mind; the ſecond that it is a debt, and therefore wee are to performe it. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from the obiect on which it muſt be fixed, and that is the Lord, and the moſt High: therefore the firſt lookes for feare, becauſe a Lord, and the other lookes for magnanimitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe moſt high: and therefore Chriſtians muſt be no baſe minded perſons, taken vp with the world, and things here below, but they muſt vp on high to God that dwells in the heauen of heauens, who onely hath immortalitie, and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the light, that none can attaine vnto, whom neuer man ſaw, neither can ſee: and therefore an high eſtimation beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the Saints in prayſing of God, that hath abaſed himſelfe to behold miſerable man, and accept at his hands the offring of thankſgiuing.
<note place="margin">Foure things notable for Chriſtian pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe; 1. purpoſe, 2. promiſe, 3. vowes, 4. oathes.</note> Thirdly, the extent of our praiſe, which muſt reach as high as vowes: for there be foure excellent helpes in the practiſe of all Chriſtian duties, which carefully beeing obſerued, will ſtrengthen all our actions. The firſt is, when wee goe about any good dutie, to deale thus with our ſoules: ſurely by the grace of God I purpoſe to ſet my ſelfe about this action. 2. That my purpoſes be not vaine, I enter couenant with the Lord, and promiſe that that which I haue purpoſed, I will performe vnto him. 3. That I may be no couenant-breaker, I vow vnto the Lord my obedience. 4. That I may not be raſh in my vowes, I proceed further, and ſay with Dauid, I haue ſworne that I will keepe thy righteous ſtatutes. Now when the Deuill, my corrupt fleſh, the world,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21235:14"/>or any worker of iniquitie, ſhall ſet vpon mee, thus will I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; Why would you haue me breake my purpoſes, and be inconſtant in my reſolutions, ſeeing the world deſpiſeth all inconſtancie: againe, though I might change my purpoſe, yet my promiſe I will not alter; for infidelitie is hated of all: but if you will ſay, you may put off the performance of your promiſe, becauſe you beare men in hand with diſpenſations of future obedience, yet I haue a third thing that binds mee more ſtraightly, and that is a holy vow vnto the Lord, which being lawfully made. I muſt not breake for a world of wealth: yet if you will be inſtant vpon mee, and ſay, I was too raſh in my haſty vowing, then I pray you conſider, that I haue ſworn vnto the Lord; and therefore to haue God to count mee for a periured perſon, would ſting mee at the heart, and ſuffer my conſcience neuer to be at peace with mee: therefore putting all theſe together, purpoſe, promiſe, vow, and oath, how ſhould I doe this great thing you require, and ſinne againſt my God: theſe things beeing practiſed, I dare boldly ſay e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Chriſtian ſhall find daily increaſe of grace, and more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe to ſerue God.</p>

Wherein wee haue the two parts of all Gods ſentences, truth and holineſſe: for it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that euery ſentence of God be true and holy: the truth in theſe words, theſe things haſt thou done: the holineſſe in the reſt.</p>
               <p>The truth is moſt exact, conſiſting of all requiſits:
<note place="margin">Truth.</note> firſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge without all errour: 2. integritie without all partialitie: 3. equitie without all contradiction. The firſt is cleare, in that the Lord enters vpon the very particular ſinnes of an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, (theſe things) and therefore can no way be deceiued; for hee that ſees things in generall, and theſe things in ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, leaues nothing vntouched. The ſecond is alſo moſt eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, for the Lord reſpects neither the perſon, nor the ſinne of the perſon: but ſaies plainely, thou, and theſe things. And the third is apparant to euery eye, for the Lord handles no matters either vpon ſuſpicion or malice: for he is moſt certain of the fact: neither doth hee complaine of any thing but the fault, haſt thou done: and therefore what ſhall an hypocrite plead for himſelfe, when hee ſhall ſee his doings plainely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected?</p>
               <p>The holineſſe of the Lord hath two parts,
<note place="margin">Holineſſe.</note> both which are contained in the ſecond part of this ſentence, and they are mercie and iuſtice: for a holy God muſt be a mercifull God,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21235:16"/>and a iuſt God: his mercie in theſe words, <hi>I held my tongue, and thou thoughteſt that I was like thee:</hi> his iuſtice in the reſt.
<note place="margin">Mercie.</note> Gods mercie is deſcribed by foure things: Firſt, by his adiunct or qualitie, ſilence. 2. By the ſubiect about which it is conuerſant, and that is the doings of the wicked. 3. By his accidentall effect, and that is the thoughts of the wicked. 4. By the forme and manner of theſe thoughts, and that is to make God like themſelues, or meaſure God by themſelues.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of Gods holineſſe is his iuſtice,
<note place="margin">Iuſtice.</note> deſcribed by power and comely order: by power in theſe words, I will reprooue thee: where wee haue foure things to manifeſt the power: Firſt, the efficient cauſe, the Lord, and therefore moſt powerfull iuſtice. Secondly, the forme, reproofe, iuſtice vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatiue or puniſhing, not remunaratiue or rewarding; and therefore ſo much the ſtronger: the touch of his little fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is able to doe much, and therefore what ſhall be the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his whole hand, and the ſtrength of his arme? his breath which in man is nothing, yet in himſelfe makes ſmoaking coles, and flames of fire iſſue out of his mouth to the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all ſinners. 3. From the obiect, ſinne, which all the iuſtice of man is not able to find out: yet ſhall this iuſtice ſearch it to the quicke, and ranſacke it to the bottome. 4. Becauſe of the perſon which is an hypocrite, who for the moſt part deceiues the whole world, yea and his owne ſoule too, yet now woe vnto him, for hee hath fallen into his hands that can not be deceiued.</p>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent: obſerue this againſt we come to the difficulties that ariſe out of Gods ordering of ſin.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:21235:28"/>and therefore let the thing bee what it will, it muſt bee made to ſerue his turne. And this ſignification is very <hi>empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall,</hi> and ſeruing for our purpoſe, and is thus much in ſenſe; as if the Lord ſhould haue ſaid, As a wicked man thinks of me, ſo muſt I be indeed, he will frame mee according to his owne conceit, and not his conceit according to that which I would haue him thinke of me, and my ſilence toward him; and this is the firſt beginning of his thought: now aſſimulation is neuer without a conceiued <hi>image,</hi>

<note place="margin">Reſolution.</note> Now a third degree is to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and that is from the imagination a direct reſolution; that I may thinke it, and acknowledge it for the truth.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon of the phraſe is this; becauſe when any thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches toward the minde of man, then the minde turnes it ſelfe vnto it, ſees how it likes it, imagines what contentment may be drawne out of it, and then thinks on it: if the thing be good, and the mind frame it ſelfe according to the ſame, then the thought that riſeth from that thinking is good: If on the contrarie it be bad, and the mind will impreſſe his <hi>image,</hi> then the thought is bad: <hi>ſilence</hi> and mercie from God in this place were exceeding comfortable, they enter the mind of this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>hypocrite,</hi> but they are not intertained in their owne <hi>name,</hi> neither will he part with ſo much as a <hi>cup of cold water</hi> for his ſake that ſent them, but he will bee refreſhed by them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his owne liking.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21235:28"/>therefore the inward corruption of the heart, ſends out ſuch ſmoakie <hi>fumes,</hi> that the true image is dimmed, and ſo they ſee nothing but themſelues.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>flowers</hi> that God ſent them all the time of his long ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, were exceeding ſweete; but the mind beeing corrupt in it ſelfe, and alſo in his breathing, infects, or rather driues backe the pleaſant ſmell; and ſo moſt truely ſents it ſelfe, yea takes the <hi>deeper poiſon,</hi> becauſe a ſweete flower poiſoned, is more louingly imbraced of the ſences, and ſo the poiſon doth creepe in with the pleaſant ſmell, and ſtrikes with the ſpirits preſently to the heart: ſo often they poiſon the good graces of Gods ſpirit, which willingly would be imbraced, but the poyſon creepes in too, into the ſoule, and ſtrikes all dead at the very heart: the <hi>glaſſe</hi> that is coloured, caſts about all the <hi>beames</hi> of the ſunne with the appearance of his colour; ſo the glaſſe of our mind beeing coloured, and deepe died withall impietie, makes euery beame of Gods goodneſſe ſhine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his owne minde; <hi>intus apparens prohibet alienum,</hi> was an old axiome of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> but well may it be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>diuinitie:</hi> ſinne that onely appeares within, hinders all grace and goodneſſe: for alas they come but as ſtrangers vnto vs, and therefore they find very meane intertainment.

                  <p>That this may the better appeare, conſider three kind of thoughts: the firſt is a direct thought, and thinkes it ſelfe: the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21235:29"/>ſecond an indirect thought, that thinkes firſt the thing, and then it ſelfe: the third is a corrupt thought, that thinks it ſelfe out of it ſelfe: the firſt is onely proper vnto God, that knows himſelfe firſt, and in himſelfe all things: God lookes not out of himſelfe to know any thing, for all things are in him: and therefore he knows himſelfe <hi>directly,</hi> the creatures <hi>indirectly:</hi> this thought is aboue the thoughts of men and Angels,
<note place="margin">Eſay 55 9.</note> as far as heauen is higher then the earth.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond belongs to <hi>men</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> in their beſt eſtate: for they muſt firſt thinke the thing, and then out of the thing themſelues: and this we call, a reflexed thought; as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a man lookes his naturall face in a glaſſe, he ſees firſt the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of his face, and then by that he knows the complexion of his reall face: ſo a man ſees Gods wiſdome in his creation, which beeing as a glaſſe,

                  <p>The third thought, is of corruption, when a man will needs looke through his owne <hi>medium:</hi> now be that lookes through his owne corruption, can ſee nothing but corruption; as a man that lookes through a red glaſſe, ſees nothing but red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: ſo he that will ſee himſelfe through himſelfe, can ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but himſelfe. And herein we ſee that corruption would become a God, deſires to know nothing but it ſelfe, and loue nothing better then it ſelfe: And this is that thought which is to be conceiued in this place. Gods <hi>ſilence</hi> muſt be tempered according to his <hi>appetite;</hi> and their <hi>taſt</hi> is ſo daintie, that they can taſt nothing but that which they themſelues haue prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; nothing is ſauorie which comes out of Gods <hi>kitchin,</hi> dreſſed by his owne <hi>cookes:</hi> but they will haue their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion, and ſo like vnskilfull <hi>dames,</hi> they put death into the <hi>pot:</hi> and when they are ſicke, they will phyſick themſelues, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they haue brought themſelues paſt all cure: and then it ſhall be too late, to crie father <hi>Abraham,</hi> haue mercie vpon vs, we are grieuouſly tormented. And ſuppoſe God ſhould then yeild them a cuppe of cold water, it ſhould not refreſh them: for as vpon earth, they counted the kingdome of grace and

                  <p>Yet one thing more is to be added, to wit, that this is not the expreſſe thought of hypocrites; for they will ſoone reply, <hi>Lord, when thought we ſo of thee?</hi> Oh, be content,
<note place="margin">Iob 9 4. Amos. 4.13.</note>

<note place="margin">3. of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> for loue would couer a multitude of ſinnes: and find the Lord ſaying in the Scriptures, <hi>be ye holy as I am holy.</hi> If any thing will ſerue the turne, here is matter to iuſtifie him: for who is able with the <hi>hypocrite,</hi> to thanke God, that he is not as other men, an <hi>extortioner, vniuſt,</hi> an <hi>adulterer;</hi> but a <hi>faſter</hi> twice a weeke, a <hi>giuer of almes,</hi> euen the tythe of all he poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.

                  <p>He may make all the world to admire at him in this place, for ſtrange <hi>impudencie,</hi> and horrible <hi>blaſphemie</hi> againſt God: for in theſe two words <hi>[like thee]</hi> is a <hi>gradation</hi> of three ſteppes, euery one riſing a ſteppe aboue an other. Firſt, to compare God with him in any ſimilitude of <hi>qualitie</hi> is ſinnefull,
<note place="margin">In qualitie.</note> becauſe he hath no qualitie that anſwereth any thing in God: but it
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21235:30"/>were well, if he would haue reſted in the qualitie: for things <hi>like,</hi> are alſo <hi>diſlike:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In eſſence.</note> but the <hi>originall</hi> in this place telleth vs plainly, that he paſſeth all the bounds of <hi>logicall compariſon,</hi> and extends it to the very <hi>beeing</hi> of God: for ſo the words are to be expounded out of the Originall, <hi>In beeing, to be like:</hi> that is, according to our Engliſh phraſe, <hi>altogether like thee:</hi> ſtrange impudencie, and voide of very reaſon it ſelfe, to make things compared <hi>as like,</hi> any further to argue then their qualities: but <hi>wickednes in the boſome of fooles is reſtles:</hi> for he riſeth one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree higher,
<note place="margin">In immortality of beeing.</note> and brings in an <hi>eternitie of beeing</hi> altogether like God: for the verbe is in the <hi>future tenſe,</hi> and ſignifieth thus much, not onely in <hi>beeing to be,</hi> but alſo in <hi>beeing ſhall be:</hi> therefore wicked men promiſe vnto themſelues an eternall fellowſhip with God.</p>
                  <p>Let vs therefore conſider what things are here compared:

For the firſt, the things compared,
<note place="margin">Tearmes: ſinne, ſilence, God, man.</note> are <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>ſilence;</hi> a <hi>wicked man</hi> and his <hi>thoughts:</hi> the <hi>proportion</hi> ſtands thus; as wicked mens thoughts are, ſo ſhall Gods ſilence be, and conſequently as wicked men are,
<note place="margin">Qualitie from condition to ſubſtance, and ſo to eternitie.</note> ſo ſhall God himſelfe be. The qualitie wherein they are compared, is threefold: 1. of <hi>condition,</hi> God muſt be like minded vnto them: 2. of <hi>ſubſtance and beeing,</hi> for they frame Gods <hi>Image</hi> according to their owne image: 3. for the <hi>qualitie of time,</hi> God muſt be an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting <hi>Patron,</hi> and fauourer of all their cauſes.</p>
                  <p>For the third, what truths ſhall we expect out of this ſtrange inuention of wicked men? ſurely none that will agree with the nature of <hi>Truth:</hi> for they haue abuſed the truth, and God himſelfe, who is the author of truth: therefore three horrible falſhoods are contained in theſe words. Firſt,
<note place="margin">The falſhoods of wicked men: Gods thoughts as mans.</note> that Gods <hi>thoughts</hi> are as mans thoughts, and Gods <hi>waies</hi> as mans waies, directly againſt the truth of God: Iſa. 55.8, 9. <hi>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your waies my waies, ſaith the Lord: for as the heauens are higher then the earth, ſo are my waies higher then your waies, and my thoughts aboue your thoughts.</hi>

As for example; being fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God is the ſubiect of all Gods <hi>reuealed wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:21235:34"/>yet this one ſubiect hath diuers manner of conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, according to diuers acts and operations that lie in him. As for example; <hi>Reaſon</hi> is a particular act, and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth a particular ſubiect of Gods wiſedome, to wit, the <hi>Art of Logicke:</hi> ſo the <hi>will,</hi> a particular worke in Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, becomes the ſubiect of <hi>Diuinitie:</hi> ſo <hi>ſpeach,</hi> a particular worke, becomes the ſubiect of <hi>Rhetoricke</hi> and <hi>Grammar.</hi> Now that generall Subiect, is before all theſe particular ſubiects, and the foundation of all the reſt; and in them the thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as common to them all: but the manner of conſidering it, is proper and ſpeciall to euery one. So <hi>man</hi> is the thing conſidered in Gods decree, therefore the moſt generall, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before all particular conſiderations of <hi>creation, fall, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, ſaluation, damnation:</hi> for all theſe are but particular conſiderations of man, therefore keepe their order appointed of the Lord for the obtaining of his owne ende, which is the glorifying of himſelfe in his Iuſtice and Mercie: therefore as man is the Subiect of Gods decree, ſo creation, the fall, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, ſaluation, and damnation, are but the meanes for the accompliſhment of his will. Againe, euery one of theſe particular actions, haue their ſpeciall ends, not oppoſing, but concurring to the generall ende of the whole ſubiect; ſo that the ende of creation is happines with the Creator, and no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie at all; but this is the ſpeciall end, and therefore no oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite of the generall. Againe, the ſpeciall ende of mans fall, is miſerie of bodie and ſoule in the firſt and ſecond death; yet no oppoſite of glorifying God in the demonſtration of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. Thirdly, the ſpeciall end of mans Redemption, is ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all that are in Chriſt, and damnation to all that are out of Chriſt: therefore all theſe ends beeing ſpeciall, muſt needes ayme at the generall: for ſo goes the Rule of all true reaſon, that <hi>ſubordinata non opponuntur:</hi> 2. that <hi>fines intermedij ſunt pro ſubordinatione finium ad vltimum finem.</hi> And this ſhall ſuffice for the oppoſition: now I come to the confirmation.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Arguments proouing the decree of ſinne: firſt drawne from ends.</note>The firſt Argument: That which hath any <hi>ende,</hi> is <hi>decreed;</hi> but ſinne hath an ende; therefore is decreed. The firſt propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is prooued from the true diſtinction of ends, laid downe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:21235:34"/>by the Philoſopher in the firſt booke of his Ethicks, and the firſt Chapter; where the Philoſopher diſputes moſt excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the <hi>ſubordination of arts,</hi> and ſo conſequently of beeings, by an argument drawne from the diſtinction of ends; to wit, that all ends are either the laſt ende, or ends tending vnto the laſt: now the laſt end, giues <hi>goodnes and amabilitie</hi> to all other ends, and doth virtually containe them all in himſelfe, therfore muſt they needes be appointed for him. This ground is a moſt enident proofe that ſinne is decreed: for the end of ſinne muſt either be the <hi>laſt ende,</hi> or tending to the laſt ende: now it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the laſt end, for that alone is <hi>chalenged</hi> of the <hi>firſt being:</hi> therefore an end tending vnto this laſt end. And who dare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but that all endes vnto the laſt ende are decreed: for they make for the manifeſtation of his glorie.
<note place="margin">Obiect. Sinne is euill, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath no ende, ſeeing ends &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes are the ſame.</note> But it will be obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, <hi>ſinne is euill,</hi> and therefore hath no ende: for <hi>finis</hi> and <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num conuertuntur.</hi> Vnto this I anſwer, that ſinne is not in it ſelfe, but by accident good, and ſeruing for Gods glorie: but the Lord which can bring <hi>light ort of darknes, good out of euill,</hi> is able to diſpoſe of the euill of ſinne by accident, and of the goodneſſe (which is his owne worke) by it ſelfe, to make for his glorie. True it is, that God in his worke goes no further then the good of the euill, and that he decrees the other, is ſaid very improperly; for euill in his <hi>abſtract nature,</hi> is neither beeing, nor the cauſe of any beeing; and therefore no good in the true approbation of goodnes: beeing not good, it hath no ende, and therefore is referred to Gods decree, as it is ſaid to belong to a beeing, and the goodnes of a beeing, and this is accidentall, therefore accidentally decreed;
<note place="margin">Sinne acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally decreed, yet impoſſible to be vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed.</note> but yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be vndecreed; becauſe the thing in him decreed, could not haue beene without him, for that good that comes out of ſin, could not haue beene, except ſinne had been; and ſinne could not haue beene, except goodneſſe had beene: and therefore beeing in Gods created goodnes and alſo God bringing from him, his owne goodneſſe to his owne glorie, he cannot eſcape Gods decree, becauſe both the other are of neceſſitie (all men confeſſing) vnder Gods decree directly. And therefore if God would haue ſinne to be in his good creatures, and alſo good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21235:35"/>from ſinne in them, then muſt ſinne ſtand to Gods deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, becauſe the other two cannot but preſuppoſe ſinne becauſe a goodneſſe from him. Now that God is no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſinne in all this, it is plaine, becauſe the two former haue God for their author, &amp; bring in the other as a hang-by, and <hi>vnwelcome gueſt,</hi> yet ſuch a one as they could not throw off at their pleaſure. Diſeaſeslie in nature, and ſometimes do good to nature, yet nature will neuer acknowledge the kindneſſe, becauſe he knew the intent was his ſubuerſion. <hi>Iaſon</hi> had an <hi>impoſtume</hi> in his bodie,
<note place="margin">An euill thing may doe good by accident.</note> the enemie thruſts his ſword into it, &amp; heales him of his impoſtume, which the Phyſitians could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer accompliſh; but no thank to Iaſons enemie which ſought his life: and therefore if ſinne doe any good either for God, or to man, it is no thankes to ſinne, ſeeing that ſinne would diſhonour God, and deſtroy man. Againe, one may appoint the iourney lawfully, but an other may walke it vnlawfully: God appoints euery man his <hi>race,</hi> but he himſelfe <hi>runs</hi> it: the <hi>horſe</hi> carries a man to his iourneyes end, and knowes not that he doth ſo much for mans good; yet man knowes it well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and guides him all the way; yet for all this the horſe vndergoes the trauell, and would be feeding by the way, and if he eate his owne poiſon, or lame himſelfe by a fall, it is the horſes fault; yet muſt he to his ende, if the man haue power to effect it: ſo the Lord hath laid vpon man his decree, he carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it with him all the dayes of his life, he knowes not to what ende, yet the Lord knowes it well enough, and doth alwaies diſpoſe of him, vntill he come at his iourneys ende: Now in his way man feeds on the <hi>poyſon of ſinne, fals and ſtumbles</hi> in his way, yet the Lord will haue him go on, for he is able to doe it; and he ſhall neuer reſt, vntill he haue accompliſhed the wil of the almightie. And therefore if this be iuſt in men, in the rule and dominion ouer their <hi>beaſts,</hi> ſhall it not bee as iuſt in the Lord? I am ſure that the Lord hath as much authority ouer vs, as we haue ouer our beaſts: therfore let vs not be too bold in diſputing with our creator, but giue him the praiſe &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of all ends.</p>

But you will anſwer, that ſinne is ordered in the bookes of conſcience, and not in the booke of Gods decree.

For if wee would make theſe three bookes one complete booke,
<note place="margin">Three bookes one compleat booke.</note> wee muſt of neceſſitie diuide them in this <hi>order and method:</hi> the firſt part is <hi>Gods decree,</hi> the ſecond is Gods <hi>reuealed law,</hi> and the third is the <hi>teſtimonie of the conſcience.</hi> Now <hi>method</hi> tells me plainely, that the <hi>firſt</hi> may be without the <hi>ſecond,</hi> for Gods <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret will</hi> may be without his <hi>reuealed will;</hi> but his reuealed can not be without his ſecret will.

Therefore graunt the third, and you graunt the two former by ineuitable conſequence. Now this third booke can not be denied, becauſe my text prooues it; and no man of reaſon contradicts it.</p>
                  <p>Againe, euery <hi>ſchoole-boy</hi> can tell me that the breaking of <hi>Priſcians</hi> head, muſt be healed by <hi>Priſcian</hi> himſelfe; the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or ſpeaking of falſe latine either againſt the firſt or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of <hi>Grammar,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The rule before the fault.</note> muſt be ordered by the rule of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar it ſelf: now the rule was before the falſe latin, therfore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines what falſe latine was, long before the ſchoole boy practiſed it. So the Law of God tells me what ſinne is when I haue committed it, but it determined what ſinne was, and to what end, long before either I, or my <hi>father Adam</hi> committed it: therfore the determination was not to follow after, though indeede the <hi>conuiction</hi> followed after the <hi>commiſſion.</hi> Therfore <hi>orthodoxall</hi> is the diſtinction of Gods <hi>decree,</hi> and the <hi>execution</hi> of his decree: of Gods <hi>determination,</hi> and the accompliſhment thereof: of Gods <hi>definitiue ſentence,</hi> and the manifeſtation of it: of his <hi>reprobation</hi> of a man, and the <hi>conuiction</hi> of a ſinner: all the former I may tearme the <hi>premiſſes,</hi> and the latter Gods <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion</hi>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:21235:36"/>in the premiſſes. Againe, there is the firſt propoſition, which is Gods truth and ſole wiſdome; the ſecond (which we call the <hi>minor)</hi> is the ſpeciall application of it vnto man in his good time. Gen. 15. Iſrael muſt ſerue 400. yeares; but Exod. 12. 400 are compleat; therefore muſt Iſrael out of Egypt that very ſelfe ſame day. There is a day in which God will iudge the world; <hi>Atheiſts</hi> may denie it, 2. Pet. 3. but when the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree ſhall be aſſumed, now is the day, I dare boldly conclude, that thoſe perſons ſhall periſh. So in like manner all men are decreed of the Lord to manifeſt his iuſtice and mercie, in all that either God himſelfe doth, or man can doe: but I am one of theſe all, and therefore muſt I manifeſt either his iuſtice or mercie: if that, then either I muſt be ſaued, or damned: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, that is a harſh concluſion both in regard of God, and in regard of my ſelfe: well conſider, that it is one thing to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of thy ſinne, and another thing to puniſh thee: aſſure thy ſelfe that this is good reaſon, that euery law of God muſt determine before thou doe any thing, els were the rule no wiſdome of God; but alſo take this with thee, that thou ſhalt neuer take any hurt by the law, vntill thou thy ſelfe haue done ſome hurt vnto it: <hi>the Law will not ſting, vntill thou haue ſtung thy ſelfe, and then take heede of poiſon vnto death.</hi> And therefore ſeeing Gods wiſdome runnes along in this order to determine all matters, not caſually, but certenly, long before they come to paſſe; we ſhould yeild it, and not denie it, becauſe of the execution which followes after, which hath other iuſt cauſes then Gods decree, but none to exclude it.</p>

                     <hi>God is Alpha and Omega, the firſt and the laſt, the beginning and the ende,</hi> therefore nothing before him, neither any thing after him: therfore he cloſeth all things in theſe two tearmes: therefore euery thing muſt haue ſomething to doe with this <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>laſt,</hi> as from him, and to him: therefore muſt they be decreed, els ſhould they not be from him, and to him. Hence ſinne comming within the limits of this <hi>circle,</hi> that incloſeth all things, muſt needes ſome way come from God, and be for God, and therefore decreed. How ſinne may be from God, and to God, is hard to explaine; yet in my <hi>poore iudgement,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:21235:36"/>the correction of my betters, I iudge this the moſt true and ſafeſt, that the good the Lord will haue out of euil, is from God, and to God; all the reſt that remaines, is nothing at all for Gods purpoſe, and therefore he hath no hand in it; he will haue the <hi>gold</hi> by his owne fining, but the droſſe he will leaue to the firſt inuentors, that digged vnto themſelues ſuch kinde of pits, that would hold no <hi>water</hi> for the Lord of hoſts, but ſuch as he drew out by his <hi>prerogatiue royall,</hi> ouer all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and their actions. Therefore thus is ſinne decreed, and the Lord had his hand in it. For the other conſideration of <hi>ſinne as ſinne,</hi> it is a by-reſpect in it ſelfe, nothing tending to Gods purpoſe; but onely as the Lord drew his owne goodnes out of him.

                  <p>But to come more neerly,
<note place="margin">How Gods lawe works ſinne.</note> we may expreſſe this moſt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly in a compariſon taken from an <hi>earthen pitcher,</hi> daſhed by the hand of a man againſt a <hi>ſtone wall;</hi> that the wall break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, that is no fault of the walls, but rather the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:21235:38"/>of it, working according to his owne nature; but the fault is in the partie that daſhed it againſt the wall: ſo man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daſhed by the deuill, and himſelfe, and the ſerpent, and the woman vpon the law of God, (too hard to bee ouerwraſtled of man) was broken in peices: yet the lawe was without all fault; onely the fault was in the <hi>deuill, Adam,</hi> and the <hi>woman:</hi> the law therefore a moſt iuſt, and holy cauſe of mans fall: as the law cauſed mans ſinne, ſo I dare boldly ſay that God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, yet moſt holily and iuſtly. Hence it followeth moſt plainely, that God was no bare <hi>permitting cauſe,</hi> or a forſaking cauſe; but a working cauſe, euen in the fall of man: now as God did it, ſo he was able to doe it, and ſo to decree it to his owne glorie, according as it ſeemed beſt vnto his own wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and ſo might it be willed as abſolutely good and iuſt, and therefore no ſinne. God made them the beginners of their owne actions, beeing indued with free will; by well doing they might deſerue both <hi>praiſe</hi> and <hi>prize;</hi> and by ill doing might deſerue both <hi>diſpraiſe</hi> and <hi>puniſhment.</hi> But you will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, then God might both will it, and not will it. Very true, as God willed it, it had reſpect of good, and was iuſt, and therefore to be willed; but as they willed it, it was euill, and ſo God hated it, and his law forbad it. The ſonne may deſire the death of his father, and ſo may God too; but in ſo doing the ſonne ſinnes againſt God, yet God is free from ſinne: the Iudge deſires that a malefactor ſhould die, ſo doth the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, yet may be the hang-man is guilty of murther, when the Iudge is a true executioner of iuſtice.</p>

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:21235:39"/>I anſwer, if wee ſoberly conceiue of the nature of a cauſe by fortune, we ſhal not much ſwarue, if we ſay ſinne was chance in regard of Gods will: for chance and fortune accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to true reaſon, is nothing but the <hi>accident or euent</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing beſide his end and ſcope: now only good is the end and ſcope of Gods will, and therfore ſinne which is not good is beſide Gods ſcope and ende; therefore it is accidentall in Gods ſcope and end. But you wil ſay, then God was ignorant of mans ſinne: I anſwer, no; becauſe ſinne is not onely <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall to a good ende,</hi> but alſo an <hi>aberration</hi> from the true rule of wiſdome, and muſt ſtand to the iudgement and ſentence thereof; which cannot be done except wiſedome take notice of it, and moſt truely God vnderſtands the aberation: &amp; from hence it followeth, that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued it could neuer touch that goodnes which was well pleaſing vnto himſelfe: fortune and chance to men, is both in the ſcope and aberration to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſcope: the ignorance neuer lies in the ſcope, but in the aberration: for a man that miſſeth his ſcope, intent, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, knowes that it is ſo; but yet he conceiues not the means that brought that thing to paſſe; and ſo he is ignorant, not for the ſcope and end that hath happened, but he knows not how he came to that end: therefore ſinne being beſide Gods ſcope is accidental, and neuer intended of God: yet God cannot be ignorant of it, in ſo much as his eyes did ſee the aberration, &amp; how it was the direct way to fruſtrate man of his good ende with himſelfe.</p>

                  <p>Furthermore, God doth not onely puniſh one ſinne with another, where there is ſuch a dependance of one vpon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that where one goeth before, the other muſt follow; but oftentimes, when there is no ſuch neceſſarie dependance, yet he withdraweth his grace, and for the puniſhment of one ſinne, letteth men runne into another. In this ſenſe, there are three things attributed to God, in the puniſhment of wicked and godleſſe men. 1. the blinding of their vnderſtanding. 2. the hardening of their hearts. 3. the giuing of them vp vnto a reprohate ſenſe: Eſa. 6.10. <hi>Make the heart of this people fat, their cares heauie, and ſhut their eyes, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe things God is ſaid to doe three waies. 1. in denying grace, which ſhould lighten the vnderſtanding, and ſoften and mollifie the hearts of men. 2. permitting Sathan to worke vpon them, and no way either ſtrengthening them againſt him, or weakning his force. 3. occaſionally and by accident, when God doth that which is good, which yet he knoweth through the euill diſpoſition that is in men, will increaſe their wickednes, and make it greater then it was before.

                  <p>Laſtly, for both entrance and progreſſe, a double action is giuen vnto God: 1. limitation, 2. direction. For the firſt, that God ſetteth bounds to wicked men in their wickednes, not onely in reſpect of the effect and euent, but alſo in the very inward purpoſe, affections, and deſignes, and at his pleaſure ſtoppeth them when he will, is a thing denied of none that confeſſe a God.

                  <p>Secondly, for direction that is moſt neceſſarie, he puts no ſinne into men, yet he directs it for the kind, that it ſhould be rather this ſinne then another, rather againſt theſe perſons then others, and the time when it ſhall breake forth, and for what end and purpoſe it ſhall be committed. For often men are wicked in that ſort, which had rather ſhew it in another kind; it breakes forth at ſuch a time, when they would faine haue kept it cloſe; and it falls vpon ſuch men, which they had rather ſhould haue beene done to others, whome they more maligne, and deſire to deſpite, if they were left to themſelues.

The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is of thoſe things onely which hereafter ſhall bee, and this alwaies preſuppoſeth ſome act of Gods will: for ſeeing nothing can be, vnleſſe ſome act of Gods will do paſſe vpon it, at leaſt not to hinder the beeing of it; and thus nothing can be foreſeen, as beeing hereafter for to be, vnleſſe ſome decree of God paſſe vpon it: Of this kind of preſcience, <hi>Caluin</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, and not of the other; it was not conſidered what it was poſſible for the creature to doe, or what he would doe beeing ſo created, and left vnto it ſelfe: this may well be ſaid, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe no decree of God, or determination what he would
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:21235:44"/>doe: for if it had pleaſed God, he might haue turned the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitie to another end and iſſue; but the truth is that other, to wit, what hereafter ſhall be, which though it be future and therefore contingent, yet to God it is moſt certaine, with whom all future things are preſent: and therefore beeing to be done, was moſt certainely decreed; and whatſoeuer is done and come to paſſe, wee may abſolutely conclude it was Gods will, euen long before it happened; therefore <hi>Calvin</hi> rightly affirmeth, that Gods foreſight of the entrance of ſin, preſuppoſed his decree, that it ſhould enter.</p>

To the ſecond difficultie,
<note place="margin">Secondly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</note> the Doctors of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> haue made it, and affirme it:

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:21235:47"/>of his permiſſion, makes not any certitude of that action; becauſe it ought to haue ſome effectuall cauſe: therefore for as much as God did foreknow that he would permit <hi>Lucifer</hi> to ſinne, from this it could not be that the obiection of Lucifers fall ſhould be anſwered; ſeeing that God doth not only know it, but alſo knowes that he will not <hi>co-oporate</hi> with him to the producing of a neceſſarie act; and therefore withdrawing, he omits as well as Lucifer: for how ſhould Lucifer but omit, when the firſt cauſe withholds his influence, and againe the Lord that he will co-operate to the ſubſtance of an act forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; and therefore it followes that God commits it. What <hi>blaſphemies</hi> would theſe be in the mouthes of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? yet good diuinitie in the ſchooles of Rome. But thus they expound themſelues, that God worketh, decreeth, and willeth the deformitie that is found in the ſinnes of commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not by his <hi>antecedent will,</hi> whereby he worketh things out of his owne liking, but by his <hi>conſequent</hi> and <hi>conditionall</hi> will, whereby preſuppoſing the purpoſe of ſuffering his creature to auert and turne from him, he ſtill intendeth to mooue, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and carrie them forward, though beeing by their owne fault out of the way, hee carrieth them thither whither they ſhould not goe: firſt, ſay they, by ſubſtraction of grace, vpon the withdrawing whereof he ſawe the creature would turne from him, he purpoſed to ſuffer the ſinne of auerſion or omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to enter: ſecondly, this purpoſe beeing preſuppoſed, and foreſeeing that which would follow vpon it, in his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and conditionall will, he poſitiuely decreed the other, which is of commiſſion. Man by creation was made to ſeeke an infinite good, and loue it infinitely; which if he omit to ſeeke in God, then muſt he needes commit the contrarie, and ſeeke it in himſelfe: for ſo God decreed, that man not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing to adhere vnto him, ſhould fall into ſelfe-<hi>loue, pride,</hi> and all euills of that kind. All this might bee borne withall, ſaue onely they make deformitie of the eſſence of an action, which cannot be borne withall: for indeed it is ſo farre from agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with an action, that he will not ſuffer him to take vp any dwelling in him: and therefore I prooued before in expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:21235:47"/>of thoſe words <hi>[Theſe things haſt thou done]</hi> that no action was the ſubiect of ſinne; and therefore well might the action be cauſed of God without all fault of his. But to anſwer the doubt. 1. They differ, in that omiſſion is a <hi>morall defect,</hi> but commiſſion is a <hi>morall act;</hi> the one is not doing morally that which is commanded, and the other is a morall doing of that which is forbidden. 2. The one lookes at the law, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, but denies his act; the other at the law, as forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and yet performes his act. Now the will of God is poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely carried vnto neither of both; but permiſſiuely to the creature, and accidentally to the effect. Yet you will obiect; then God permits that which he wills not, and if he will it not, how can it be done? Here I dare not be ſo bold as our <hi>Diuines</hi> are, though I thinke we haue all one meaning; that Gods will is firſt carried vpon his permiſſion; ſecondly vpon the thing permitted: As his will is carried vpon his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, he wills that abſolutely, and by an affirmatiue act, but as vpon the thing permitted, it is <hi>non impedire,</hi> not to hinder it; and that is <hi>actus negativus.</hi> And this muſt be taken notice of, becauſe Gods will muſt haue ſome thing to intercede, and come betwixt it ſelfe and ſinne: for a will immediatly carried vpon ſinne, is alwaies ſinnefull: therefore permiſſion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming betwixt Gods wil, and ſinne, frees God from the action of ſinne.</p>
                     <p>To the fourth obiection, I anſwer, that priuations are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſidered as <hi>oppoſites</hi> with their <hi>habits,</hi> or as <hi>adiuncts</hi> with their <hi>ſubiects:</hi> in the firſt conſideration, the habite is that which doth affirme it ſelfe to be exiſtent, or in nature may be exiſtent: the priuation cleane contrarie, denies this to be in nature, nay worſe then that, ſhewes that he is expelled from ſuch a ſubiect, which now makes him appeare, as though he were the <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>houſe,</hi> and beare the full do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. As <hi>life</hi> is a naturall thing, <hi>death</hi> comes and ſaies, there ſhall be no life in this ſubiect; and when life is gone, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect makes death appeare, as though he were the commander of lifes habitation: night comes and ſaies, where now is light? and becauſe no man can ſee the light, he is faine to giue dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:21235:48"/>a good word, and ſay he hath poſſeſſed the <hi>circle</hi> of the <hi>world:</hi> yet neither will the world confeſſe he hath receiued any beeing by darkneſſe, or the ſubiect of life any further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence by the preſence of death. Therfore he is neither being in himſelfe, or giuing being to his ſubiect, but taking away a being: yet becauſe the ſubiect into which he is receiued, by reaſon that he alwaies lookes vpon his adiunct, giues him the denomination of beeing, as long as he reſts with him; yet in his ſimple nature the neuer can be ſo conſidered, but as a <hi>meere tyrant</hi> to beeing and eſſence; which agree ſo ill, that if the one come, the other muſt be gone. And this is the reaſon why <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne</hi> is ſaid to raigne; which could not be, but for our <hi>members</hi> which giue him leaue to ſtay with vs. The <hi>Ivie</hi> hath no roote or exiſtence from a proper principall of life, but moſt louingly embraceth the <hi>Oke,</hi> and for all his ſtrength, the Ivie will eate out his heart, ſecretly, and bring him to death: ſo ſinne hath no roote of his owne, yet moſt familiarly be cloſeth with our nature, and eateth out the heart of all goodnes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vs, and ſpeedily bringeth vs vnto miſerie.</p>
                     <p>For the laſt obiection: ſinne is called an <hi>habit</hi> and <hi>qualitie,</hi> therefore beeing. The anſwer is, as ſinne is <hi>habitus in ſubiecto,</hi> it hath that name: yet properly, ſinne is no habit: for it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies his negation and oppoſite, therefore can not properly haue the name of his oppoſite: yet beeing crept into <hi>vertues cloſet,</hi> deſires to put on his habit, that ſo he may haue the more loue and <hi>welcome;</hi> as <hi>tyrants</hi> when they haue gotten the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of lawfull <hi>Princes,</hi> will be very glad to put on any title that might pleaſe them, whome they deſire to become their ſubiects; and for this cauſe will be content to change their names: ſo ſinne, a meere tyrant, will <hi>maske</hi> it ſelfe in the habit of vertue, that ſo we may eſteeme the better of him, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſubiect our ſelues to his vntolerable yoke.</p>

                     <p>A ſecond thing that they impoſe vpon our men is,
<note place="margin">Contradiction put vpon Gods will.</note> that they make God in his will contradict himſelfe; to will <hi>ſinne to bee,</hi> and to will ſinne not <hi>to bee,</hi> are contradictorie: theſe cannot differ <hi>reſpectiuely,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">

The ſecond act is, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, Gods diſpenſation; and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to prouidence, where God wils no euill thing to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, yet vpon the accident will he diſpoſe of it: A careful <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> of a family wills not euill to happen in his houſe, yet he is carefull to diſpoſe of any euill accident; and this hath nothing to doe with Gods deeree. The third action is, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, and here it is true, that God does permit ſinne; but to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſinne, comes farre ſhort of willing ſinne to be: and for the obiect that is moſt certaine, that the verie tearmes are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictorie, to will <hi>ſinne to be,</hi> and to will it not <hi>to bee:</hi> wherefore finding neither contrarie wills to bring forth contrarie acts, nor contrary acts about one ſubiect, nor one ſubiect to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to contrarie acts, we conclude, to will ſinne to bee, and not to be, to defend contradiction.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, they make Gods will to haue euil effects, as to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline</hi> to finne, to <hi>harden</hi> not onely by deſertion, but <hi>actiuely,</hi> and <hi>poſitiuely,</hi> yea to <hi>impell, conſtraine, command Sathan and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men to conceiue, plot, and attempt miſcheife.</hi> nay more, <hi>effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer

And this is further to be preſſed vpon our <hi>Diuines,</hi> by the conſideration of a double ſinne; one of <hi>commiſſion,</hi> and another of <hi>omiſſion:</hi> the one <hi>de vetito,</hi> of the thing forbidden, and that is commiſſion; the other <hi>de praecep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi>
                        <pb n="83" facs="tcp:21235:50"/>of the thing commanded, and that is omiſſion. Now not to hinder a ſinne of commiſſion, is by our Diuines, to concurre to the very act, which cannot be done of man without ſinne; yea and God is ſaid ſo to concurre, that he is the firſt cauſe of that act, man the ſecond; God moouing man, and in that ſort, that man neceſſarily muſt followe Gods power in moouing him, and ſo of neceſſitie muſt produce this act: and therefore the commiſſion is principally laid vpon God. Againe, not to bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſinne of omiſſion, is <hi>(by their ſentence)</hi> not to giue man that grace whereby he might be kept from the ſinne of omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or made able to performe the contrarie: therefore God concurring to the firſt, and denying his grace to the ſecond, muſt needes commit and omit, that which man commits and omits. Nay more then that, not onely a concauſe, but a ſole cauſe; becauſe man can not reſiſt the motion of the firſt cauſe, and therefore cannot offend following an irreſiſtable moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeeing hee could not ſinne <hi>propria voluntate,</hi> but by Gods compulſion. Here then it ſeemes that the decree is effectuall, 1. becauſe not barely permiſſiue, and 2. becauſe they make the not hindring ioyne with the euent, as a neceſſarie cauſe.</p>
                     <p>But here they diſtinguiſh, firſt of the <hi>neceſſitie of conſequence,</hi> and the <hi>neceſſitie of a cauſe,</hi> or the reaſons themſelues; as if I ſhould ſay, a man is a <hi>lyon,</hi> then the conſequent is neceſſarie, that he hath <hi>foure legges;</hi> yet the reaſons or parts are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie: for it is neither neceſſarie that man ſhould be a lyon, or foure footed. But the anſwer may be infringed, that the conſequence is either of a <hi>propoſition,</hi> or a <hi>ſyllogiſme:</hi> and then the conſequence which is the <hi>concluſion,</hi> followes by way of cauſe: as for the example, if a man be a lyon, then he is foure footed, is a neceſſarie conſequence: but now aſſume; a man is a lyon, this is contingent, yea falſe; and will neuer ſuffer the conſequent to be concluded. But in Gods decree they make it alſo to aſſume and inferre the concluſion, and therefore a cauſe. As for example; That which God hath decreed, comes to paſſe; but mans fall is decreed; therefore it comes to paſſe. Here Gods decree, can haue no other force of reaſon to preſſe the concluſion, but a cauſe.</p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:21235:51"/>
                     <p> Secondly they anſwer, that the antecedent beeing granted, and from thence the conſequent concluded is cauſall, when there comes no middle cauſe betwixt them: but God decrees that man ſhould fall by his free-will, comming betwixt the fall, and Gods decree thereof. But this is no anſwer: for ſo mans free-will, came betwixt the Deuils temptation, and the yeilding thereunto: and ſo the Deuill ſhould be no cauſe of mans fall: this then is but a ſhift.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly they anſwer, that God may will that man ſhould fall, and yet man might fall by his owne free will. The anſwer is ouerturned, becauſe a man might haue fallen infallibly, and freely: but neceſſarily, and freely, can neuer ſtand together. Infallibilitie is in reſpect of Gods <hi>infinite diuine preſcience:</hi> but neceſſitie is of the thing done,

But the queſtion is, whether man could wil ſuch a thing or no; if it be ſaid he could, then hee ſinned freely; but againe how could he will this? if it be anſwered, he could not, then ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God made him will it: if he could, then what was the cauſe of it? ſurely they defend that God did forſake him, before he willed to bee forſaken, in that he forſooke to giue him that grace which ſhould haue kept him from ſinne.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, there commeth nothing betwixt Gods deſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and mans willing of it; if ſo, then either God or man muſt be the cauſe; not man, becauſe he ſuffers it, therefore God:

Neither are we here to conceiue coaction or violence; for the will hath two motions, one of <hi>nature,</hi> another of <hi>libertie:</hi> libertie is taken away, when the will is carried with his naturall motion; this is <hi>ſpontaneus aſſenſus,</hi> a natural willing, which is alwaies of one thing. To be happie, is willed of all, but neither by violence, or freedome, but natural inclination; for no man wills miſcrie. Therefore Gods decree takes away his libertie, but not his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to mooue naturally which way God would haue it. And though it be not conſtrained, yet can it not reſiſt, neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede would it reſiſt, for this determination.
<note place="margin">Neceſſitie and libertie cannot ſtand together.</note> Thirdly and laſtly, <hi>neceſſitie</hi> takes away all <hi>libertie,</hi> becauſe all libertie is in contingent things. What libertie hath a man ouer the <hi>fire,</hi> or any immutable thing? Againe, libertie is alwaies with <hi>conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:</hi> now conſultation is in things contingent. What man will conſult whether the fire burne? and ſurely God and man vnderſtands one truth, how then ſhould I conceiue that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to God, which muſt be contingent to me? Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencie and neceſſitie can neuer ſtand together. And to ſay <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> fell contingently, and yet neceſſarily, is an impoſſibilitie. The principle of neceſſitie is immutabilitie, not infallibilitie. Certitude makes infallibilitie: that which is certen, is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:

                        <note place="margin">Time changeth not nature.</note> and ſo may a contingent thing be certen.

He may make a man, and not reaſonable; fire, but not hote. Let it then be what it will be, if once it might haue bin changed, it can neuer be made an vnchangeable nature by time. <hi>Achilles</hi> might haue killed <hi>Hector; Saul</hi> might haue fallen on his owne <hi>ſword; Adam</hi> might haue runne into the finne of auerſion from God. Theſe before they were done, you confeſſe, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent: but Achilles hath ſlaine Hector, Saul is fallen on his owne ſword, Adam is become an Apoſtata from God: now the caſe is altered, and they are become neceſſarie. But do you not vnderſtand reaſon? tell me, I pray you; Achilles to kill Hector, Saul to fall on his ſword, Adam to ſinne, what argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:21235:52"/>are they in reaſon? ſurely cauſes and effects. Now to kil, and may kill; fall, and may fall; ſinne, and may ſinne, what new inuention haue they brought into reaſon? are they not ſtill cauſe a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d effect? A man may laugh, therfore if he bring his facultie into exerciſe, it is become neceſſarie. Surely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a reaſon <hi>in potentia,</hi> in power to argue, and <hi>actu,</hi> there is no ſubſtantiall change. The <hi>Coryphaeus of Logitians</hi> defines an argument, <hi>quod eſt ad arguendum affectum,</hi> that is, which is affected to argue. All men know, that the power of a thing, is more neere the beeing then the act, and therfore a thing can part with his act, but neuer with his power or facultie. A man doth not alwaies laugh, nay he may alwaies be a mourning <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> yet he cannot part with the facultie. And if it was contingent for Adam to fall, ſurely beeing fallen the cauſe is not altered, onely that which might be, is come to paſſe: That which <hi>I feared,</hi> ſaies <hi>Iob, is come vpon me:</hi> when he feared it, it was contingent; but now it is neceſſarie: ſtrange reaſon, that for bringing a thing into act, that was in power to the act, or for a little change of time, nature ſhould be altered: fire will be fire whereſoeuer it is, and nature will be nature whenſoeuer it is. Let any anſwer me this one thing; did God intend to create all things neceſſarie, or ſome things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and ſome things contingent? If all things neceſſarie, then let vs become <hi>Stoickes:</hi> if ſome things contingent, then I aske when thoſe contingent things were made? did they then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come neceſſarie? where is then any contingent thing made of God? Euery thing you ſay is neceſſarie, when it is: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when God had made all things, all things were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. This kinde of diſcourſe will hold no water: and for my part, away with this neceſſitie. But doe you deſire to know what a neceſſarie thing is? then in a word it is this;
<note place="margin">The definition of neceſſitie.</note> That which is alwaies true, and neither can, nor could be otherwiſe. To be alwaies true, is common to contingencie and neceſſitie: for God with whome all things are preſent, knew them alwaies to be true, yet not neceſſarie: but here lies the difference, that neither <hi>can</hi> nor <hi>could</hi> be otherwiſe. Dare any affirme this of Adam? ſurely then farwell all libertie, and make God the true
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:21235:53"/>cauſe of ſinne: for beloued, immutabilitie and neceſſitie are moſt principally in God, and therefore from him: and where you finde them, acknowledge God the author. If then Adams fall was of this kind, it muſt needes be from God. This argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be cleared, when I come to the anſwers.</p>

That it is a puniſhment, I prooue it thus; Puniſhments according to the <hi>Schooles,</hi> are either <hi>poena ſenſus,</hi> or <hi>poena damni;</hi> the puniſhment of ſenſe, lies in ſenſible tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the puniſhment of the damned, by an <hi>Emphaſis,</hi> is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from God: now reprobation is a ſeparation from God, becauſe it is Gods deſertion of man: thus then if they make Gods will euill, the decree of his will an effectuall cauſe of ſinne, mans will neceſſarily thereunto compelled, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation mans ende (or if you pleaſe) a meanes vnto the ſame; then will it follow, that they make God the author of ſinne: but all this you ſee prooued; and therefore our diuines make God the author of ſinne.

                     <p>To the firſt argument from Gods will, that he wills the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, exiſting, and euent of ſinne: I anſwer by this diſtinction, that there is a double being,
<note place="margin">Gods willing of ſinne to be, is not the beeing of ſinne.</note> exiſting, or euent of ſinne; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of a double cauſe: Firſt, that which man giues vnto it, proceeding from his free-will, and this is none of Gods: the ſecond is from God, and that is an exiſting, beeing, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent which God will draw out of ſinne; and this is not ſinnes beeing, exiſting, or euent; but Gods: therefore when they
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:21235:53"/>ſay, God wills that ſinne ſhould be, that is, he wills a beeing out of ſinne; firſt, his owne glorie: ſecondly, a better good then otherwiſe man could haue knowne: and this <hi>fiat, ſit, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niat, exiſtat,</hi> (which be the words of our Diuines) is good: and that this is their meaning it is cleare: for ſay they, God wills ſinne to be for his glorie; now ſinne in his owne nature is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his glorie; therefore he cannot will the being of ſinne: for then ſhould he will againſt his glorie; but he wills ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, beeing, or exiſting, which he knowes will make for his glorie. Secondly, God wills ſinne to bee, exiſt, happen, from man onely; but that is the firſt beeing of ſinne, as the ſinnefull action lookes at the ſinnefull man, whereof you heard before, that a ſinnefull action was onely in ſenſe an action, done by a ſinnefull perſon. But you will ſay, how ſhould this be done without ſinne? I anſwer, here God is firſt ſaid to permi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>it to be done: ſecondly to worke it by accident: but you will ſay, comes any thing to paſſe becauſe God permits? yes, therefore it comes to paſſe, becauſe God will permit; for that which God will not permit, cannot come to paſſe; and this hee doth moſt willingly: Now when God permits in this ſort, he is ſaid not to concurre with the worker of the thing; but leaues him freely to himſelfe: &amp; this is that deſertion which our Diuines ſpeake of; for if God ſhould haue concurred to haue produced in man the act of not willing ſinne, and haue confirmed him in the contrarie, then man ſhould not haue fallen: and this is that which <hi>Caluin</hi> affirmes, that God gaue Adam <hi>poſſe quod vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luit, ſed non velle quod potuit:</hi> that is, to be able to doe what he would, but not to will that which he had power to will: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that not impedition, permiſſion, or deſertion, was a cauſe why he did not will; but none why he did will that which he did will. But you will obiect, that <hi>not to will</hi> was a ſinne, and God was the cauſe of that: I anſwer, it is both a ſinne, and no ſinne: a ſinne when it flowes from a will that is immediately bound vnto it, therefore the very not willing was in Adam a ſinne of omiſſion: but that <hi>not to will,</hi> which Adam might haue willed, did not bind God at all: for God was not bound to make Adam to will: God might with-drawe himſelfe from
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:21235:54"/>that willing, which Adam doing ſinned againſt God: Adam was bound to doe it <hi>actually;</hi> and God was only bound by the law of <hi>creation,</hi> and his owne wiſdome to giue him ſufficient power that he might doe it:
<note place="margin">Man was bound actually to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but that God ſhould bring forth the act was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie.</note> God was not bound vnto the act of willing Adam to ſtand: now both the will and deed are from God, and therfore where God denies the deed, he is the cauſe why the deed is not: as if I denie to helpe an idle man, which hath power to goe; I am the cauſe, why he is not hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and for want of my helpe he will not goe; that he would not goe, it is a fault in himſelfe; and if he goe backeward, it is alſo his fault. If a friend ſhould ſay vnto me, I will not go vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a place, except you will goe with me: I anſwer him <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily,</hi> I will not goe with you: now that hee is not gone withall, I am the cauſe; but that he himſelfe would not goe, it is his fault; and if he promiſed his iourney, he alone hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his word. God ſaies, I will <hi>permit ſinne;</hi> and man ſaies, Lord then I both can, and it is my will to doe it; wel, go too man, and trie the iſſue; but Lord wilt thou not binder my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tempted by the deuill: no, man, I will not doe it: why then Lord I and the deuill will conſent together to ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee: well, trie your freewill: ſo then, Gods permiſſion is a not impedition; this not impedition is a deſertion, not of his power to the power of the creature, <hi>for in him we liue, moue, and haue our beeing:</hi> but of his will to the will of the creature; and therefore the wil of the creature becomes his own wil; by his own will he turnes from God, &amp; ſo he turnes it vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; for he will be like God: therefore I dare boldly ſay, that the not willing of Adam, was fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, becauſe he would not giue the deed; and that deed beeing denied, man did the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.

                     <p>But further the argument is vrged; <hi>no euill is to be done,</hi> nay not ſo much as willed, <hi>that good might come thereof.</hi> To will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, or to doe euill, and bring the end as an excuſe, is impious: therefore who ſpeakes in this ſort?

It is true, God wils good out of euill, that is, not to turne euill into a better na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for heauen and earth will as ſoone meet; but only make it the obiect of his permiſſiue will. Now God can haue his will, neither permiſſiue nor effectuall about any obiect, but he will raiſe his glorie out of it: and therefore out of the ruines of ſinne and vngodlineſſe, is he able to build vp his glorie: and this is to will euill, the obiect of his permiſſiue will, for his owne names ſake. I am ſure euery ſlender Logitian knows there is great difference betwixt an obiect, and an effect. If Adam had made euill but his obiect, and neuer haue effected it, it would haue prooued but a temptation iniected of the deuill, and no ſinne of his. Why then ſhould it follow, if God doe <hi>decernere de peccato,</hi> exerciſe both iudgement and will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſinne; iudgement to know it, will to limit it, diſcretion to direct it, and iuſtice to puniſh it. And therefore as the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from the ende is nothing, ſo from the obiect, that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:21235:56"/>ſinne is alwaies conſidered as ſinne. Let it be graunted, can therefore the excellent wiſdome of God extract nothing out of it? yes: for euill will be in good, and God will ſo ſeparate it from the good, that it can not otherwiſe be but ſome thing ſhould be fined and refined by it; yet ſo, that ſinne ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be nothing but <hi>droſſe and dung, ſtubble and ſtraw</hi> for hell fire. For the contradiction in Gods will, it is none at all: for in contradiction, the <hi>affirmation</hi> and <hi>negation</hi> muſt be of one thing. A man is blind, and not blind, are no contradiction; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the one may be vnderſtood of the eies of the bodie, and the other of the eies of the ſoule; <hi>Apius eſt caecus, Apius non eſt caecus,</hi> is no contradiction. Therefore God to will ſinne by his permiſſiue will, and not by his effectuall will, make no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions. For the laſt branch of this argument; God <hi>inclines, impells, conſtraines,</hi> as they are naturall acts, adde alſo <hi>hardnes, commands</hi> wicked inſtruments, and doth effectually procure them to execute his iuſt iudgements; the motion is Gods act ordinarie, the iudgement is Gods act morall, and the ſinne his permiſſiue act. He that ſtrikes againſt God, ſhall be ſo ſtricken againe that he ſhall ſuffer: and therefore as the ſmiths hammar ſtriking againſt his hands, hardeneth them by oppoſition; ſo God the hearts of men, by his iuſt iudgements oppoſing them.</p>

                     <p>The firſt part of the Argument reſting vpon that Sophiſme of <hi>Arminius,</hi> is alreadie cleared. To the ſecond,
<note place="margin">Gods decree not the workes of ſinne, but conuerſant in it, in ordering and diſpoſing.</note> concerning the neceſſary copulation of Gods decree, and ſinne: Firſt I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, they are not <hi>cauſe</hi> and <hi>effect;</hi> becauſe Gods decree is an act vpon ſinne, and therefore <hi>ſubiect</hi> and <hi>adiunct.</hi> But you will inquire what neceſſitie is there of the connexion of theſe two parts? I anſwer, Gods decree, and mans fall, doe not make a <hi>neceſſarie</hi> ſentence, but <hi>contingent,</hi> yet moſt <hi>infallible</hi> and true; becauſe it was the act of an <hi>infinite wiſdome,</hi> that could not be deceiued; and hereupon his iudgement was moſt infallibly
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:21235:57"/>true of mans fall. If an expert <hi>Phyſitian</hi> ſhould foretell the death of his <hi>patient,</hi> and were moſt certen of it; muſt it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be neceſſarie when it comes to paſſe,
<note place="margin">Determination no cauſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie.</note> becauſe he foretold it? no; for the truth is the ſame that it was before, onely it is now more euident to others that knew it not: ſo God moſt certenly knew the fall of man and determined of it, euen as the Phyſitian determines of the <hi>fit in an ague</hi> wherein his patient ſhall die, and farre more certenly: he will not miſſeit a <hi>minute</hi> of time. Could the <hi>deuill</hi> tell <hi>Saul,</hi> yea, and determine of it, <hi>To morrow ſhalt thou and thy ſonnes be with me;</hi> and yet ſhall not God be able to ſet downe the exact time of mans <hi>apoſtacie?</hi> And if the Lord haue determined the day and houre wherein Adam ſhould die, ſhall he therefore be the neceſſarie cauſe of his death? You will not accuſe the Phyſitian as a <hi>murtherer,</hi> becauſe he foretold the time wherein his patient ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part; nay, you will ſcarſe accuſe the Deuill, becauſe he ſaid, <hi>to morrow;</hi> but confeſſe that <hi>Saul</hi> himſelfe fell on his own ſword: onely this makes vs ſay the Deuill did it, becauſe he hath bin a <hi>murtherer from the beginning.</hi> And as God ſaies, Is there any <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill of puniſhment</hi> in the citie, and I haue not done it? ſo dare I ſay, is there any euill of ſinne in the world, and Sathan hath not done it?

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:21235:57"/>neuer produce this, that God is the author of ſinne, or vniuſt. Suppoſe an armie of men were comming againſt <hi>England,</hi> would not the King and his Councill, aſſemble to deliberate and conſult, that they might preuent them? and therefore though the thing be moſt certain, yet it is not neceſſarie: The <hi>towne</hi> is on fire; if it were neceſſarie it ſhould burne the town, what then ſhould men do crying for helpe? yet it might bee ſome knewe for a certentie, that the towne would be burnt; is it therefore neceſſarie? But you will ſay, euery thing when it is, is <hi>neceſſarie that it ſhould be:</hi> I anſwer, that this beeing ſhould become exiſtent, was neuer neceſſarie;
<note place="margin">A thing to bee when it is, is not neceſſarie for the cauſe, but that it is a kind of beeing vnder ſome head of entity where it is neceſſarie.</note> yet that this beeing ſhould be ſomething, is moſt neceſſarie. And therfore I admire that though many meane wel, yet they ſhould neuer diſtinguiſh betwixt an an effect, and a <hi>ſpecies</hi> of beeing. The effect lookes onely at cauſes; now the cauſes of mans fal, were no wayes neceſſarie; either when they were in power to act, or when they did really produce: and therefore as man was a contingent cauſe till he fell; ſo when he was fallen, he was ſtil the ſame cauſe; onely his power was brought into act; and all our diſpute is on this head, as mans fall was an effect.</p>
                     <p>But now you come and ſay, this effect was neceſſarie; how I pray you? becauſe you ſay, <hi>quicquid eſt, quando eſt neceſſarium eſt eſſe:</hi> marke your predication, which is of that word <hi>eſſe,</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>quicquid eſt quando eſt:</hi> now, what is that <hi>eſſe, to quicquid eſt quando eſt?</hi> I tell you no <hi>effect,</hi> but a <hi>ſpecies:</hi> now the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of any <hi>genus,</hi> is a neceſſarie <hi>axiome</hi> when it is diſpoſed. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which is exiſting in the world, to be brought vnder ſome head of beeing is moſt neceſſarie; for God is the God of order: ſinne therefore, or rather the action of ſinne, (for ſinne cannot haue an <hi>eſt,</hi> though it may haue a <hi>quando eſt</hi>) as beeing referred to the <hi>predicament</hi> of action,

God made man, therefore for ſome ende, for ſome end therefore to be able to work vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; and how ſhould he doe this without his guide; and ſome rule of wiſdom muſt be giuen him, which rule is able to guide him in euerie action vnto his ende: therefore Gods concourſe
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:21235:58"/>or confluxe with his creature is nothing but the <hi>ſtamping</hi> of this wiſdome vpon him, whereby he is carried vnto his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, that gaue it him.

But let vs haue a fewe more examples, before we come to application and reſolution: God hath giuen man his <hi>reaſon,</hi> this beeing is for ſome end, this end is <hi>bene diſſerere,</hi> to reaſon well: now for this end the facultie muſt exerciſe it ſelfe; and that the facultie may exerciſe it ſelfe, God hath ſtamped vpon mans reaſon the rule of <hi>Logick,</hi> or diſcerning wel of euery thing that god hath made; for all things were made for man: and therefore muſt God beſtow an eye vpon him whereby he may ſee all things, and this eie is the eie of reaſon guided by Logicke, ſo that Logicke concurring with my reaſon, is able to make me pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any act, directly carried vnto his ende. God hath giuen me <hi>ſpeech,</hi> this is for ſome end, as to ſpeake <hi>wel</hi> or <hi>eloquently;</hi> for this ende muſt I exerciſe my ſpeech, and that I may not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe in vaine, he hath giuen me the rule of <hi>Grammar</hi> and <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricke;</hi> which rules concurring with my ſpeech, I ſpeak both truely and eloquently.</p>

Now how did God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre with them? ſurely no otherwiſe then by the true rules of art, immediately taught them of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>The ſunne in the heauens runnes his race with ioyfulneſſe; and if you aske me by what concourſe of God; I anſwer pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily, by no other then the rule of <hi>naturall Philoſophy,</hi> which God created with the ſunne. That this may a little the better ſhewe it ſelfe, conſider that all beeings beſides himſelfe were made of nothing for himſelfe: in all theſe things, God
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:21235:59"/>can but haue the reſpect of two cauſes; the firſt is efficient, the ſecond finall: hence God is called <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the firſt, and the laſt, the beginning and the ende: and hence hee can giue a beeing vnto things, but not his owne beeing; and ſo his beeing muſt be out of creatures, and therefore muſt other cauſes be giuen by him,
<note place="margin">The efficient &amp; the end giue to the effect, but not themſelues, matter and forme giue all they haue.</note> which cannot onely giue a being, but their owne beeing: and theſe be two, <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>forme:</hi> the <hi>wood</hi> and <hi>forme</hi> of a table are in the table it ſelfe; but the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter onely giues a beeing of efficiencie, and not himſelfe: and thus God made all his workes ſtand out from himſelfe, to himſelfe, and that with their matter and forme: and thus all the creatures became beeings from God, not onely of that <hi>eſſe,</hi> that God gaue them, but alſo of that <hi>eſſentia</hi> which gaue beeing, and his owne beeing, that ſo in themſelues by the forme extending it ſelfe ouer the matter, <hi>qualities</hi> and <hi>faculties</hi> beeing araiſed, it might haue power to act and worke not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the glorie of his creator, but alſo for that ſpeciall good which God ſawe in all that he had made, when he ſaid, they were good, yea, and very good.</p>
                     <p>Hence I would entreat theſe obſeruations; Firſt, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature owes vnto God,

                     <p>Secondly, obſerue that the whole glorie of the <hi>creature,</hi> is the glorie of the <hi>Creator:</hi> becauſe the glorie of a thing lies eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in his end, which ende is an indiuiduall companion of matter &amp; forme, which matter and forme were giuen of God.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, all things in the creature, are depending vpon the Creator; the <hi>beeing, nature welbeeing, eupraxie, vertue, actions,</hi> and <hi>life</hi> it ſelfe: <hi>in him we liue, mooue, and haue our beeing.</hi>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:21235:61"/>many outward appearances; therefore queſtionleſſe he knew the fruit. But then you will obiect, man was more fooliſh then the woman; for ſhee did it by <hi>ſtrong perſwaſions:</hi> and he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more adoe vpon his very wiues giuing it, did eate thereof: alas, neuer thinke ſo. But how then was he tempted? ſurely, I thinke it was not a new diſputation betwixt his wife and himſelfe; that as the deuil had dealt with her, ſo ſhe might deale with her husband: for if <hi>Adam</hi> had been abſent all the while of that communication, and then the <hi>ſerpent,</hi> and the <hi>deuill in the ſerpent</hi> had been departed, that Adam would ſo ſoone haue yeelded vnto her motion. Secondly it is ſaid, that as ſoone as ſhee deſired it, <hi>ſhe tooke it, and did eate:</hi> if this was done in the place where ſhee ſtood, then aſſuredly her eyes would haue been open, to haue ſeene the offence, before ſhe could haue brought Adam vnto it. Thirdly, if ſhe muſt firſt haue plucked the fruit, and then haue carried it to Adam, and laſtly haue diſputed with Adam for the eating of it, it had been too long a time, for a <hi>woman with child</hi> in ſinning, and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging for an <hi>apple</hi> or a <hi>figge,</hi> (or what elſe the fruit was) to haue ſtaied her <hi>appetite</hi> ſo long: and therefore as I doubt not but ſhe preſently are it, ſo preſently her husband yeelded too; and ſo both their eyes were opened together.</p>
                     <p>But you will ſay, did Adam ſtand by all the time of their diſputation? I know no other meaning of the text, but that it ſhould be ſo: and therefore Adam was exceedingly too blame to ſuffer his wife to haue ſuch communication with the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; hee ſhould haue ſhut him out at the firſt entrance; for God ſet him to keepe the <hi>garden,</hi> that no <hi>beaſts</hi> ſhould come in it. Now tell me, I beſeech you, what concourſe Gods law had in mans fall, and the ſelfe-ſame is my iudgement that God had in it: Now the lawe ſtood at hand, to haue ioyned with man, to haue brought forth his obedience vnto God, and haue kept him from all ſinnes of omiſſion; but man would not heare the voice of the lawe, but of the deuill againſt the law, therefore no maruell if he fell. So then the Lord concurred by his law; I will vſe the word of <hi>Arminius, quantum decuit,</hi> yea, and <hi>quantum oportuit,</hi> as much as was ſeemely, and as much as
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:21235:62"/>was expedient: and this none of our Diuines denie, if I may ſpeake it <hi>bona venia,</hi> with the good liking of all <hi>Arminians:</hi> ſo that God withheld none of this grace from him: but as I ſaid before, the <hi>deede</hi> of his will, or that <hi>velle quod potuit,</hi> which was not of ſuch abſolute neceſſitie; neither wanted man any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, if he had been as good as his meanes were.</p>
                     <p>But you ſay further,

Alas, had they all thoſe free actions in ſinne, and yet did nothing <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prijs voluntatibus?</hi> I ſee nothing at all done by them, but was done moſt freely.

And againe with <hi>Arminius,</hi> God forbid it ſhould be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, but that <hi>conſilium Deiſtaret,</hi> that Gods counſell ſhould ſtand: and therefore God hath an irreſiſtable will: and if that, then the motion of his will is alſo <hi>irreſiſtable;</hi> if this, then man cannot reſiſt it, and if he cannot reſiſt, then is hee mooued irreſiſtably to ſinne:
<note place="margin">Fiue propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to explaine how Gods will cannot be reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted.</note> ſtay, there the conſequence is falſe. I know you will graunt me theſe fiue <hi>propoſitions,</hi> and I know no more that our Diuines defend: firſt, that Gods will is the ſupreame cauſe: ſecondly, that Gods will cannot ſuffer: thirdly, that none can reſiſt it: fourthly, that his motion is likewiſe irreſiſtable: fiftly, that neither men nor angels can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt it. But tell mee how you can prooue your conſequence, therefore man in ſinning followes Gods irreſiſtable motion; I know no ſuch conſequence, either in the Scriptures, or our men; for euery motion of Adam and the woman were moſt free, and they followed moſt willingly their owne motion. But you will ſay, God decreed this motion; true, yet no cauſe thereof: for he decreed man ſhould be the cauſe of it himſelfe. But could this be done, and yet God be no cauſe thereof? yes aſſuredly; for you are deceiued of Gods decree, by putting
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:21235:62"/>it into the thing, when it is in himſelfe. And here I will cleare vnto you another way, that God takes in his decree then you imagine.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Gods decree ariſeth from his <hi>efficiencie,</hi>

And that it riſeth from omnipotencie and efficiencie it is plaine: for in that he did it, we ſay he could doe it, and ſo decreed it: and the ſentence muſt bee of ſuch things as are within his power; ſo that election is nothing but the choiſe of a thing, and <hi>decretum</hi> the decree, nothing but the ſetting of it done definitiuely: the word is of <hi>decerno,</hi> to ſee a ſunder, and verie fitly ſignifieth this determination of God: <hi>ſententia,</hi> ſentence, though the Lord doth all things <hi>ſimul,</hi> and <hi>ſemel,</hi> at once and together, in reſpect of himſelfe, yet to vs he ſhewes it, as if he did it <hi>peditentim,</hi> ſtep by ſteppe, and that with great and long determination: therefore a ſentence where his will and power giue in their verdict, and ſay, <hi>ſic ſentio,</hi> ſo I iudge. The third word <hi>definita,</hi> or <hi>definitiua,</hi> definite or definitiue, is the determination or defining of a thing <hi>inter cancellos,</hi> within his bounds: <hi>in conſilio, con</hi> &amp; <hi>ſalio,</hi> where many things leape together, or concurre to make vp one ſentence: ſo that a man is as it were diſtracted about the compoſing of them, the Lord did it without all diſtractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; yet were there many things that the Lord brought together: <hi>Eterno,</hi> eternall, becauſe it was long before any thing was exiſtent: <hi>de rebus faciendis,</hi> it is of matters to bee done, and not of things alreadie done;

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:21235:64"/>geneſi,</hi> that is, before he compoſe any thing according to his firſt conceit, which is not before, but after himſelfe: but Gods, is neither before, nor after himſelfe: and therefore we muſt not looke firſt for Gods <hi>Idaeas</hi> in things, and then in God; but firſt in God, and then in things.</p>
                     <p>And here I beſeech you, take notice of the abſurditie of many Diuines, and groſſe ignorance, concerning the point of Election and Reprobation, <hi>expraeviſa maſſa corrupta,</hi> that it needs muſt be of man in the eſtate of his ſinne: and ſo make Gods <hi>Idaea,</hi> or the plot of his counſell, whereby he decreed, to be firſt in the things, and then in God; which is cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Indeede we vſe to ſay you ſtand there, therefore I ſee you; and not I ſee you, and therefore you are there: but in God it is contrarie: God ſaw Adam to fall, and therefore be fell. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, preſcience can not be properly in God, ſeeing God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly ſees all at once and together, and therefore can not ſee one thing before an other: yet as God lookes vpon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, one thing is ſaide to goe before an other; and this may be tearmed preſcience: but this is that ſecond knowledge of God, which we call indirect: and here all things are ſeene of God, as they are the images of his wiſdome. For if he ſee all things in himſelfe, then muſt he needes ſee all things out of himſelfe indirectly; the reaſon is, becauſe whatſoeuer God ſees directly it is himſelfe: and therefore the creatures beeing not himſelfe, he ſees them indirectly. The <hi>Schoole-men</hi> ſpeake much of this <hi>ſpeculum trinitatis:</hi> for, ſay they, Angels &amp; Saints ſee in God, otherwiſe then by the creatures, and therefore are able to know any thing. It is true God can reueale, yea and hath reuealed, not onely vnto Saints in heauen, but Apoſtles and Prophets, many things that neuer came by the way of the creature: yet we muſt conceiue that the Lord did <hi>irradiate</hi> and ſhine vpon their vnderſtanding by an other image then his owne: and therefore it was diuine reuelation, by working vpon their vnderſtandings an <hi>Idaea</hi> or plot of knowledge which is out of himſelfe. As God is ſaid to view all <hi>principles,</hi> that is, the ſimple beeing of things, he is called an <hi>intelligent, wiſe,</hi> and <hi>vnderſtanding God:</hi> 2. the <hi>truth</hi> of theſe things: and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:21235:64"/>this is Gods <hi>omniſcience,</hi> for the preſent,
<note place="margin">God fore know ledge.</note> or preſcience for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and neither of both are idle ſpeculations. Therefore Gods knowledge, or foreknowledge, beeing of truths, and truths are to pronounce as things are, and things are, becauſe God doth pronounce them to be: therefore God vſeth to ſay, I know you not, I doe not acknowledge you. Againe, the Lord knowes the way of the righteous, that is, works it, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooues it. And therefore it is not according to the <hi>Papists,</hi> whome the Lord foreknew would doe good; or the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi> whome he knew would beleeue; or others, whome he knew would not fall: but his will and knowledge goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                     <p>I can as well ſay, God had a will to doe all things that were poſſible, as well as a preſcience: for his will was omnipotent as well as his knowledge; and therefore hee could as well, if it pleaſed him, to will any poſſible thing to be, as to foreknowe it to be: yet this I am ſure of, that a thing poſſible, and now come to paſſe, was as well willed of God, as foreknowne of God. And though I would bring no ſtrange opinions, yet this ſeemes to be reaſonable, that whatſoeuer God knowes, it is either ſomething or nothing: now ſomething is immediately demonſtrated from his will: this thing is, becauſe God willed it, for his will is the cauſe of all beings, &amp; not his knowledge: therefore to vs in any beeing, we muſt firſt take notice of his will, and then of his knowledge. Man is fallen, this is the will of God, and not his meere foreſight: for things done, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be reſolued into an higher cauſe then his will: and for <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> that is alwaies vnderſtood <hi>per oppoſitum ens,</hi> by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, which is ſome thing.</p>
                     <p>Now becauſe further we find in the creatures,
<note place="margin">No diſcourſe in God, yet in his creatures, one reaſon puls in another.</note> 
                        <hi>prius &amp; poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> a firſt and a ſecond; ſo that here we conceiue of God, as though he did diſcourſe of one thing from another. The truth is, he ſees them <hi>ſimul</hi> and <hi>ſemel,</hi> yet becauſe for our capacitie he hath ſaid, he hath <hi>antica, poſtica,</hi> a face, and back parts; and his back-parts are reuealed vnto vs by a <hi>prius</hi> and <hi>poſterius,</hi> a firſt &amp; a laſt, we giue ſapience vnto God, which is of all <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſions,</hi> and diductions from their true fountaines. Againe, becauſe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:21235:65"/>the Lord hath ſet an order, and contriued euery thing moſt fitly and conueniently for time, place, and perſon, we call him a prudent God. And as he hath moſt ſubſtantially effected all things, we call it great art and skill. Now all this cannot be, without the good will and pleaſure of our God, which reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting himſelfe, makes himſelfe the chiefe good: and therefore he made the world, for no neede he had of it. Secondly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the creatures bearing his image, they were all of them good, yea and very good: if all were done, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Thus then you haue heard the concourſe of God with his creature; the creature depending, muſt be gouerned; beeing gouerned, muſt obey; obeying, muſt obſerue his rule; and yet beeing mutable, may leaue off to giue due reſpect vnto it: and this, <hi>non attendentia,</hi> makes him ſlippe out of Gods way into his owne, as may plainly be ſeene by the firſt ſinne, where the Law offered his concourſe, but man denied his.</p>
                     <p>Againe, you ſee how God doth decree in himſelfe; and therefore firſt we are to know, that God in decreeing, follows no creature, <hi>directa cognitione:</hi> ſecondly in manifeſting his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sree, it is done <hi>cognitione indirecta,</hi> firſt generall, in his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for from his efficiencie and omnipotencie, <hi>potuit,</hi> he could reueale it: hence in reſpect of himſelfe, being meere acts, he could not haue any ſuch attribute; for <hi>potuit,</hi> may be, or could be, can neuer be ſaid of him that euer was <hi>actu:</hi> therfore muſt it reſpect the things that may be, &amp; may feele the act of God:
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:21235:65"/>hence <hi>qua potuit, efficit,</hi> as he could bring them forth, ſo he did it moſt effectually. Now becauſe omnipotencie, and efficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, reſpects both <hi>poſſe,</hi> and <hi>efficere,</hi> to be able, and to doe;

Now becauſe this decree of God, cannot but be brought to paſſe after the beſt way and manner: therefore muſt he decree by counſell; if by counſell, then muſt the ſcope be prefixed; therefore muſt the ende of it manifeſt his glorie; therefore all his goodneſſe, therefore his vertues, which are his attributes; and if them, then his iuſtice and mercie. To doe by counſell, is to haue ſome expreſſe forme of working, the plot whereof makes euery thing agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his counſell: this plot ſeemes good vnto his wiſedom, and this the Lord wills, and that with a moſt free will, <hi>arbitrio iudicij, libertate voluntatis,</hi> wit and will.</p>
                     <p>Out of theſe grounds we eaſily anſwer the doubt,
<note place="margin">Application to the doubt.</note> that God did neither omit or commit any thing in mans fall: he did not omit, for the rule was at hand, and mans facultie to doe well was ſufficient: the concourſe was not in man, therefore did he omit, denying the law that due reſpect that it challenged. I told you before, that neither the law alone, nor the facultie alone was able to produce the act of obedience; therefore the law alone could not do it: not that it was an vnſufficient rule, but becauſe man would not practiſe this rule. Now you know it is ſaid to be impoſſible vnto the law, not in regard of it ſelfe, but in regard of vs that cannot concurre with it, to that righteouſneſſe which it exacteth, which we might haue done by creation. For commiſſion it is plaine, that the Lord did no otherwiſe concurre with mans fall, then the law did; which you haue heard in explication of the cauſes of the firſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, was no <hi>cauſa perſe,</hi> but <hi>cauſa per accidens,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an vnblameable cauſe. If man will ruſh againſt it, what fault can he finde with the lawe, if it doe miſchiefe him? Hee that takes a ſword by the poynt, is ſure to wound himſelfe, which if he had taken by the handle, might haue been vſed both for defence, and offence. But it is further replied, the motion of man to finne followed Gods motion, which was
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:21235:66"/>irreſiſtable: True it is, the will of God is irreſiſtable when it is oppoſed; and therefore in reſiſting the will of God, he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed an irreſiſtable motion; in oppoſing the law of God, he ſuffered his owne ouerthrowe. So that <hi>reſiſtentia,</hi> beeing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of enemies, that ſuffer mutably, and God beeing <hi>ſine paſſione reſiſtentia,</hi> without <hi>paſſion</hi> or <hi>reſiſtence,</hi> and therefore cannot be reſiſted. Then your meaning is this, that man was a reſolute enemie to ſinning, and fought with God about this action; but God would haue man to ſinne, and ſo man ſhould not reſiſt. But alas, it was cleane contrarie, Gods will was not to haue man to ſinne, and mans will was to ſinne; and therefore hee fought againſt Gods wil, yet could he not reſiſt Gods will, or falſifie the leaſt of his decrees.</p>

If God ſhould haue reſiſted mans will, he ſhould not haue ſinned. Therfore the cauſes beeing ſeparate, ſo iudge of the effects; the effect of Gods will is neceſſarie, becauſe it hath the beſt ende; but mans effect was contingent, and had the worſt ende.

The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, is <hi>externall</hi> or <hi>materiall,</hi> which is exerciſed vpon the creature: and this is in time, and limited according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the creature that receiueth it; and this is contingent. The third is, a complete or perfect action of both, which they call <gap reason="foreign">

<note place="margin">Extremam admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere manum.</note> a perfect finiſhing of the thing: and this bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſolute, and proceeding from abſolute cauſes, is in his conioyned nature, neceſſarie: yet no argument to prooue, that one cauſe ſhould make the other neceſſarie. And therfore the will of God, makes mans will no neceſſarie cauſe of his owne fall. But to this connexion it is formerly replied, that it is not onely ſo in the <hi>maior</hi> propoſition, but alſo in the <hi>minor,</hi> and therefore the aſſumption beeing taken out of the <hi>maior,</hi> and concluding neceſſarily, muſt needes be cauſall; as <hi>if God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, then man muſt fall:</hi> but I aſſume, <hi>God decrees,</hi> and therfore <hi>man muſt fall:</hi> ſo that Gods decree inferring the concluſion vpon mans will, as following neceſſarily, muſt needes be a cauſe. The anſwer is, it is a neceſſarie concluſion by way of ratiocination or diſcourſe, but not from the argument it ſelfe; the diſpoſition makes it neceſſarie: but the third reaſon is no neceſſarie cauſe, ſeeing that the action of Gods decree, as out of himſelfe, and in the creature, is externally and materially to be conſidered; and ſo is not neceſſarie, but contingent, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porarie, and mutable: and therefore if it had pleaſed God, it might haue fallen out otherwiſe: for euery neceſſarie truth, is an eternall truth. And therefore that which is in time, and not eternall, is contingent, mutable, and alterable.</p>
                     <p>That which is ſaid to the interceding cauſe, betwixt Gods decree and the fall,
<note place="margin">Of the interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding cauſe.</note> to wit, mans free will, to exempt God from ſinne, is moſt true: for God did not immediatly worke mans fall. But you obiect, that the remote cauſe is as well ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as the next, becauſe the deuill was the remote cauſe, and yet guiltie of the ſame ſinne Adam commited.
<note place="margin">A ſpeciall neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooues a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</note> The anſwer is, when the cauſes are <hi>vniuocall, homogeniall,</hi> and of the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of working; but in cauſes <hi>heterogeniall</hi> and <hi>equiuocall,</hi> which are of diuerſe natures, the remote cauſe is neuer tainted with the ſame fault, that the next cauſe is: As <hi>wine</hi> is a remote
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:21235:68"/>cauſe, why a man is drunke, yet no faultie-cauſe of his drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe: The <hi>Goſpell</hi> and our <hi>Sauiour Chriſt,</hi> came to ſend a <hi>ſword</hi> into the world, but yet were no true cauſes of <hi>ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and quarrels</hi> among men; The <hi>Sunne</hi> raiſeth <hi>putrified crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> out of dead <hi>carkaſes;</hi> it can <hi>harden</hi> as well the <hi>clay,</hi> as melt the <hi>waxe:</hi> A <hi>ſonne</hi> deſires the death of his <hi>father,</hi> ſo doth God;
<note place="margin">One thing effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of diuerſe cauſes may bee faultie in one but not in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> but the ſonne breaks Gods commaundement, God doth it according to the true rule of iuſtice: a ſonne would haue his father liue, God would the contrarie, yet a ſinne in neither. And therfore a remote cauſe is onely guilty of the ſame of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence with the next, when they worke all after one forme and manner; otherwiſe the immediate cauſe is the onely author of the ſinne, al the reſt by accident and by abuſe. The <hi>Goſpel</hi> is the <hi>ſauour of death vnto death,</hi> as well as the free will of man, but not <hi>eodem genere cauſandi,</hi> after the ſame manner of working. Pharaoh hardneth his owne heart, ſo doth God, but the one <hi>immediatly,</hi> the other <hi>mediatly,</hi> by the abuſe of mans freewill. Therfore the anſwer is, from the diſtinction of remote cauſes, in vniuocall cauſes the remote cauſe is as guiltie as the next, and therefore the deuills will,
<note place="margin">In cauſes vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocall all are guiltie of the ſame crime, but not in equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</note> and mans will working <hi>vnivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> are both in the ſame offence; but Gods will and mans, worke <hi>equiuocally,</hi> the one, one way, and the other another: and therefore no neede of participation, ſeeing they haue no next <hi>genus</hi> of a cauſe in which they ſhould communicate.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Anſwer to Gods deſertion.</note>To the third euaſion, betwixt <hi>infallibilitie</hi> and <hi>neceſſitie,</hi> it is granted that man fell infallibly, but not neceſſarily; except we vnderſtand it of Gods decree in himſelfe, and then the truth was an eternall truth. And in this ſenſe our Diuines hold it; not of any neceſſitie in mans will, therefore it was only neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie in Gods wll, but contingent in mans; yet the truth it ſelfe in the thing, is to God and man contingent, to God moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but to man vncertaine. For deſertion, we hold that God did not forſake man in any neceſſarie, requiſite for his true o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience vnto the law, onely he with-held his confirmation of man. If a man were ſet in ſome office for triall of his gifts, is it neceſſarie that he ſhould be confirmed in it? I trow not and therefore this deſertion was of confirmation, and not of

Habituall</hi> and <hi>actuall</hi> miſerie had no place in man by his creation: but <hi>poſſible</hi> or <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiall</hi> miſerie, was laid in the freedome of his will, which if God had inclined vnto good, and man ſo determined, then had he come into the eſtate of the bleſſed Angels; and ſo miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie had been impoſſible, and his eſtate ſhould haue been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed vnto him with God for euer; not from the freedom of his will, but from his obedience, and Gods promiſe thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Therefore that deſertion, and not collation of neceſſarie helpe to auoide ſinne, is to be vnderſtood of this third grace; which was not a grace of creation, but a further liberallity, which God might haue beſtowed, if it had pleaſed him. But I dare not reſt ſatisfied with this anſwer, becauſe I ſee this third grace was onely to be obtained by the obedience of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that is, if he did the will of God, then would God haue beene as good as his promiſe, <hi>thou ſhalt liue:</hi> therefore in my iudgement,

                     <p>I anſwer therefore,

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:21235:69"/>to oppoſe; not for <hi>power</hi> giuen, but for <hi>preſent act:</hi> and as in this temptation the law forſooke man, ſo God may moſt iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee ſaid to forſake him. I haue before declared that two things are moſt neceſſary for euery good action, <hi>rule,</hi> and <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi> which if both concurre not, the action cannot bee produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Now the law concurred not, and therefore man was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of the lawe: not <hi>actiuely,</hi> but <hi>paſſiuely;</hi> euen as a <hi>maſter</hi> ſhould promiſe his <hi>ſeruant</hi> all aide and ſuccour, as long as hee would be faithful; but after he begins to manifeſt the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of his infidelitie, vtterly to caſt him off: ſo Gods law would haue vtterly vanquiſhed the deuill; but man proouing vnfaithfull, Gods lawe wholly reiected him. Secondly, if it had pleaſed God, he might haue kept the <hi>deuill</hi> from man, or haue aſſiſted his will, that he might neuer haue yeelded vnto the temptation: ſo then, God not giuing the will and the deed, and the law beeing forſaken, no maruell if vpon theſe deſertions man ſinned: the one had not beene wanting, had not man been wanting vnto himſelfe: and the preſence of the other was not neceſſarie; neither did God in his wiſedome thinke that it was conuenient: man then had ſufficient, but not abſolutely to ſtand: and this deſertion, or confirming grace, might well bee withdrawne from man. And herein there was no merit of deſertion, except that of the lawe: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did God make man will any ſuch thing: yet concerning the former diſtinction it may well be ſaid, that Gods election freed his owne from the poſſibilitie of euerlaſting miſerie, and ſo their fall was but a paſſage to a better life: and reprobation on the contrarie ſuffered the reſt to fall, and lie in euerlaſting miſerie. For the other, that mans fall was a <hi>meere conſequence of Gods decree,</hi> it is falſe in <hi>ſimple propoſitions;</hi> but in <hi>connexion</hi> it may be true, where the parts do not force it, but the connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; as if God decree, then it muſt needes come to paſſe.</p>
                     <p>To the third argument, from mans will; I anſwer,
<note place="margin">Concerning the freedome of mans will.</note> it is not neceſſarie, that the thing which cannot be fruſtrated, ſhould conſtrain men to ſinne: <hi>The gates of hell ſhall not preuaile againſt Gods Church,</hi> this is no conſtraining of the libertie of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: Rom. 9. the Iewes were cut off; yet v. 6. it <hi>cannot be that

Now with God there is no ignorance, and he cannot worke any thing <hi>fruſtrà,</hi> or in vaine; and therefore nothing can fall out beſide his ſcope, I meane, that which he intended directly to bring to paſſe: therefore it is chance and fortune that makes vs giue God an <hi>infallibilitie</hi> of decreeing, not a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of performing: it is one thing for God infallibly to bring a thing to paſſe, and neceſſarily.</p>
                     <p>To the ſecond,
<note place="margin">The difference betwixt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall act.</note> libertie is not taken away, becauſe his act is to one thing, therefore obſerue this diſtinction; there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold act, one <hi>internall,</hi> which is <hi>immediately</hi> from the <hi>forme, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting</hi> vpon his owne <hi>matter,</hi> and this is <hi>eternall, inſeparable,</hi> and <hi>immutable.</hi> But the ſecond, which is more <hi>externall,</hi> and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on obiects out of it ſelfe, is <hi>mutable, temporall,</hi> and <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable:</hi> as for example, the <hi>facultie</hi> of <hi>laughter,</hi> as it flowes from the <hi>reaſonable ſoule,</hi> acting and beſtirring it ſelfe in our bodies, is an <hi>inſeparable act;</hi> yet that motion which ſhould bee in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of externall obiects of laughter, is ſeparable; yea, a man may be without it for euer. So then to our purpoſe, that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that ariſeth from our wills, <hi>inwardly acting,</hi> is inſeparable; yet that which ſhould worke vpon <hi>externall obiects,</hi> is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and God may determine it at his will and pleaſure; and yet let man haue his <hi>eſſentiall libertie,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The externall act is ſeparable.</note> without which the wil is not a will. If then in all naturall things, the externall act, or that which we call the ſecond, be ſeparable, why may not the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:21235:70"/>will of man be depriued of ſuch an act as this? In ſinne ſurely our will for externall obiects onely flies on euill, yet that firſt act is not taken away, whereby by Gods grace it may be ſet againe, and that in heauen, onely to runne vpon good: the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in heauen haue their libertie, and yet they are al waies to act good: God is moſt free, yet he hath neither firſt nor ſecond act which may poſſibly be inclined vnto euill.</p>
                     <p>Here <hi>Arminius</hi> for his <hi>oppoſition</hi> is faine to defend, that God hath no <hi>libertie</hi> of <hi>willing,</hi> and <hi>angels</hi> in heauen haue ſuch as they might become <hi>deuills:</hi> for I am ſure if they haue free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome as well to good as euill, then may they will euill: which if he ſhould vnderſtand of the firſt act, then it were moſt true, but they are confirmed in the ſecond act ſtill to cry, <hi>holy, holy Lord God of Sabboths.</hi> But <hi>Arminius</hi> ſaies and confeſſeth, that although God by vs, be defended to take away libertie, which he ſaies is <hi>ſecundum motum voluntatis,</hi> yet he affirmes, that the <hi>naturall motion</hi> of the will is ſtill remaning: but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther libertie, nor naturall motion, can ſtand with coaction or violence, ſeeing that both <hi>naturâ,</hi> and <hi>conſilio efficere,</hi> to worke by nature and counſell, are cauſes that produce by an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and innate principle: and therfore free from coaction and violence. And here I admire, that he hath forgotten his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke. For the third reaſon: it is true that <hi>neceſſitie</hi> and <hi>contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencie,</hi> can neuer ſtand together, but <gap reason="foreign">

                     </p>
                     <p>To the fourth obiection, that <hi>reprobation</hi> is a <hi>puniſhment,</hi> it is thus anſwered; Reprobation is either a ſimple <hi>reiection</hi> or <hi>preterition,</hi> or els damnation it ſelfe. The firſt, is <hi>opus voluntatis liberae:</hi> the ſecond, <hi>voluntatis neceſſariae.</hi> The <hi>preterition</hi> of God, is his moſt free will; but damnation is a neceſſarie act of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine iuſtice for ſinne and tranſgreſſion: 2. Theſſ. 1.6. that all men are <hi>vaſa, veſſells,</hi> that is from God, but that they are <hi>vaſa irae,</hi> veſſells of wrath, that is from themſelues. Gen. 1. all Gods workes were good: Ioh. 8. when the deuill ſpeakes a lie, <hi>ex proprijs loquitur,</hi> he ſpeakes it of himſelfe, becauſe he is a lyar, and the father of lies: and therefore, when we ſinne, we ſinne
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:21235:71"/>of our ſelues. Yet beſides all this, there is a third, and that is <hi>vaſa praeparata,</hi>

So then Gods preterition is no puniſhment, neither is his prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a veſſell: but damnation is a puniſhment, and that is neuer without ſinne. Againe, <hi>diſcernere</hi> and <hi>ordinare,</hi> differ as a generall and ſpeciall. To diſcerne of any thing, is the whole worke of reaſon; but to ordaine, is a ſpeciall part of reaſon in diſpoſing of all things orderly. So then Gods decree is the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or perfect worke of his counſell concerning man: ordination is that, which <hi>à principio ad finem media reſpicit,</hi> lookes how to lay things together from the beginning to the ende. Now all this may be done of God in reprobation, and yet makes it no puniſhment. Firſt, that God doth diſcerne or decree by counſell, is reaſon and iudgement; which are no puniſhments, but neceſſarily goe before them: ſo then Gods decree of reprobation, is not the <hi>Iayler in the priſon,</hi> or the <hi>hangman on the gallowes,</hi> but the <hi>Iudge on the white throne,</hi> whoſe putitie tries all things. It is not therefore neceſſarie, becauſe God ſentenceth all things, that he ſhould puniſh them: for this is <hi>ſapientis iudicis praevidere,
<note place="margin">A logicall act and a morall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the other, ordination which more properly is in the things done, God diſpoſeth of them according to his decree that went before with counſell and deliberation; neither is this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny puniſhment: for as decreeing, ſo ordaining are of reaſon and iudgment: now reaſon and iudgment puniſheth no man, for they are logicall acts, but to puniſh is a morall act: and therfore no neceſſitie why we ſhould confound them. So then ſimply to paſſe by, or prepare a damnation by decree, counſell and ordination are no puniſhments at all. But you will ſay, to be forſaken of his creator, cannot but be a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Alas you do here miſconſtrue the meaning of our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines: for they ſay, that election is <hi>ad ſupernaturalem gratiam, non naturalem:</hi> and <hi>reprobatio eſt praeteritio non quoad naturalem gratiam,</hi> but <hi>ſupernaturalem:</hi> that is, election is to a ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall grace; &amp; reprobation is the forſaking of a man according to this eſtate, not for his natural eſtate, or that wherein he was
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:21235:71"/>created, and ſo God neuer forſakes him; but in the other, he forſakes him, and yet it is no puniſhment, that ſo the Lord ſhould doe: for it is neither <hi>a priuatiue euil,</hi> or <hi>poſitiue</hi> vnto man,
<note place="margin">Reprobation neither a priua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue or poſitiue euill.</note> ſeeing all priuations and wants, are of ſuch things as once we had: and poſitiue euills of ſuch, as vexe and trouble vs. Now to want ſupernaturall grace, was neuer the want of a created man, becauſe he neuer had it: neither by creation could he feele any want of it, ſeeing God had giuen him enough.

                     <hi>I. A. Occaſion</hi> taken from the creatures, is not to make God depend on them for his will, but abſolutely to will that occaſion; yet if that occaſion had not bin giuen from them, God would neuer haue willed, decreed, or ordained it. The <hi>ſubiection</hi> of the creature to vanitie, is from him that ſubiected it; yet if man his cauſe, had not giuen this occaſion, God had neuer willed this ſubiection. It was Gods will, that Chriſt ſhould be ſent, which neuer had bin willed of God, but vpon the occaſion of mans fall. It is Gods will that ſinne ſhould be puniſhed, yet mans fall gaue the occaſion, without which God would neuer haue puniſhed man. Gen. 18. Exod. 32.1. Sam. 2. <hi>The Iudge of the whole world, will doe iuſtly.</hi> 2. <hi>He that ſinnes ſhall be put out of my booke.</hi> 3. <hi>God forbid, but that they that honour me, ſhould be honoured of me; and they that contemne me, ſhould be contemned of me.</hi> Yet in all this irrogation, or impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of puniſhment, the Lord is abſolute and independent; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the creature would leaue nothing vnaſſaied, to eſcape Gods hand.</p>

                  <p> 
                     <hi>Collat.</hi> M. <hi>Perkins</hi> meaning is, to make God independent euery wayes; and therefore by a <hi>Synechdoche,</hi> he puts ſecond cauſes, for all kind of reaſon that can bee drawne from them. Now cauſation is the firſt, and moſt perfect reaſon that can be in things from God; therefore God is not onely indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as his creatures worke with him; but alſo for all other reaſon that can be drawne from them. Therefore occaſion gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the creature, beeing a reaſon, muſt either depend from God, or God muſt depend from it: if it depend from God, then Gods will was before it; but if God depend from it, then was this occaſion before Gods will: and to make any thing before Gods will, is to denie his will to be abſolute. For the three examples: Firſt, it is true, that the occaſion of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſubiection vnto vanitie, was mans ſinne; but no occaſion of Gods will, who abſolutely willed as much as hee occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned. For the ſecond, mans fall was the occaſion of Chriſts ſending into the world; but not of Gods will to ſend his Son, which was before all occaſions. For the third, mans ſinne is the occaſion why God will puniſh, but no occaſion why hee ſhould ordaine to puniſh. For his admonition to diſtinguiſh betweene, to ordaine, and decree, is profitable, but not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his expoſition: For, ſaith he, to ordaine, is to ſet an order in things done, and not to ordaine <hi>facienda vt fiant,</hi> things to be done, that they may bee: But he is to know, that <hi>diſcerno,</hi> is to ſee aſunder, and is as generall as all reaſon, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all Gods works are ſeene aſunder. Of the ſame ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, from whence comes <hi>dialectica,</hi> the art of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; now reaſon is firſt to find out things: ſecondly, hauing found them out, to iudge them: which iudgement is either of truth or falſhood, as in propoſitions; or of conſequence &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequence, as in Syllogiſmes; or of order and confuſion, as in method. And in this laſt part, to ordaine is properly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, therefore is a ſpeciall branch of diſcerning: and by a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> of the ſpeciall, for the generall, may be put for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing: yet properly to decree, is a worke of counſell, wiſely diſcerning of euerie ſpeciall reaſon, truth, conſequent, or any
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:21235:74"/>other thing, that may make for his ſcope prefixed: then to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, is the wiſe laying together of all theſe things, that all confuſion and diſorder may be eſcaped, and euery thing moſt ſweetly brought vnto his end appointed of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Here take notice of three kinds of knowledge diſputed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Schoolemen:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Knowledge poſſibile, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, conditional.</note> 1. <hi>poſſibilis intelligentia:</hi> 2. <hi>actualis:</hi> 3. <hi>conditionalis.</hi> The firſt is of all poſſible things, that neuer ſhall be: the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, of all things that are, or ſhal be: the third, of ſuch things as would bee, if ſuch and ſuch things went before; <hi>If Caine doe well, he ſhall be accepted,</hi> Gen. 4. if <hi>Dauid ſtay in Kei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah, the lords of the citie will deliuer him:</hi> if I continue in belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, then I ſhall be ſaued; if I continue in ſinne, I ſhall bee damned. And on this knowledge, for any thing that I can perceiue, doe the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi> hang all predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and ſo make Gods will the conſequent in decreeing, and mans will the antecedent in giuing God the occaſion. The deceit is this, that from the connexion of things, they iudge of Gods will about things; which is moſt indirect, and a knowledge that agrees not to God, but at the ſecond hand. It is true, that the firſt knowledge, beeing iudged according to logicall inuention, is of things poſſible: for arguments or reaſons afore they come to bee diſpoſed, are onely <hi>in potentia ad arguendum,</hi> haue an affection to argue: and ſo many things that might be, haue this potentiall kind of reaſon; and ſo we ſay they are knowne of God, becauſe we ſo conceiue of them. The ſecond knowledge, which is more actuall, is properly <hi>ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> the laying together of thoſe things which before were onely in affection to argue. The third is of theſe things, which beeing laid together, can no otherwiſe haue force of reaſon, but vpon <hi>connexion</hi> and <hi>ſuppoſition:</hi> and in this head, would they tie Gods decree and knowledge; when indeed God fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes no ſuch ſuppoſitions, but abſolutely knowes and wills what he pleaſeth: yet ſeeing his decree is as large as all reaſon, it cannot otherwiſe be imagined, but that in the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, all reaſon ſhould appeare. And ſo we grant a conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion, ſuppoſition, condition, and occaſion in all Gods works that is in the effects of his will, but none of all theſe in the will
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:21235:74"/>it ſelfe. Therefore they doe amiſſe to put that vpon his will, which is the cauſe, which ought to be in the effect of his will, and thereupon no antecedent of Gods will, but meere conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents: That <hi>creation</hi> ſhould go before the <hi>fall,</hi> the <hi>fall</hi> before <hi>redemption, redemption</hi> before <hi>ſaluation,</hi> and <hi>ſinne</hi> before <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> are all of them moſt neceſſarie ſuppoſitions, connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, conditions, and if you pleaſe, occaſions. And thus much for that occaſion, which is to <hi>Arminius, delphicus gladius;</hi> but it cuts aſunder ſuch knots as God hath tied together, whoſe will in all things drawes the firſt linke, and cannot be drawne of any.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. Per.</hi> 3. Principle <hi>in ſenſe</hi> is this, that God does all by <hi>counſell,</hi> therefore he hath his <hi>ſcope,</hi> which he knowes, wills, and diſpoſeth vnto moſt <hi>prudently:</hi> and therefore decrees eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing therevnto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I. Ar.</hi> The moſt wiſe God doth all things for ſome ende and purpoſe, euen that which he doth not, yet hee permits it for ſome ende and purpoſe: therefore, firſt it is a fault to ſay, that God muſt either <hi>agere,</hi> be doing; or <hi>otioſe ſpectare,</hi> become an idle beholder; which is no good diſtribution: for <hi>agere</hi> and <hi>permittere,</hi> to doe, and permit, are really diſtinguiſhed; and both theſe are for good purpoſe; and therefore, God muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be <hi>doing,</hi> or an idle <hi>beholder,</hi> are too ſcant, for he may <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</hi> Secondly, <hi>prudence</hi> is too ſhort a word to inlarge it ſelfe to all Gods wiſedome. Thirdly, <hi>adhibito certo fine,</hi> the ende applied, <hi>&amp; finis gratia,</hi> and for the ende, are not all one: for no man workes for the ende applied; but for the good therein implied. Fourthly, <hi>Deus non vult, aut non decernit quod non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,</hi> God neither wills, nor decrees that which he cannot: here no ſenſe, except it be further added, which he cannot do, or permit: and therefore the concluſion is moſt imperfect, <hi>ſo God decreed to doe,</hi> except this be added, or permitted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Collat. Agere prudenter,</hi> to doe wiſely, will beare the ſenſe of permiſſion: for permiſſion comming from Gods wil, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of vs as an effect; this effect is produded by counſell, therefore for a good ende and purpoſe: ſo then, that which God doth <hi>permittere,</hi> he doth <hi>prudenter agere:</hi> grant then, that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:21235:75"/>Gods permiſſion comes from his counſell, and aimes at his glorie, and then it muſt bee more then a negatiue act. But to ſpeake the truth; <hi>permiſſion,</hi> as it is expounded of <hi>Arminius,</hi> maintaines nothing but abſurdities: Firſt, in regard of the cauſe; for ſaies he, permiſſion is <hi>voluntatis remiſſae:</hi> now ſuch a will as this cannot be in God, whoſe will is meere act, and therefore cannot admit of degrees: all remiſſiueneſſe of Gods will, is in regard of the ſubiect, which is <hi>quantum;</hi> and may be leſſe and more, but in regard of himſelfe it is impoſſible. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, a remiſſe will, doth either will, or not will, or ſuſpend: to ſuſpend, is neither to hinder nor further the act, and ſo the Lord ſhould haue no ſtroke in ſinne, which is the deniall of his prouidence in the <hi>apoſtacie</hi> of man: if his prouidence did not ſuſpend, nor his power, then his wil was not to ſuſpend in that action: if he did more then ſuſpend, then it was either to will, or not to will; if not to will, then ſinne ſhould not haue beene: therefore God did will it, <hi>per modum actionis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this may appeare,
<note place="margin">Gods manner of working in ſinne.</note> we are to conſider what manner of <hi>efficient cauſes</hi> true reaſon laies downe vnto vs: And the firſt manner of cauſes efficient, are either to <hi>beget,</hi> or <hi>preſerue:</hi> the ſecond to <hi>worke alone,</hi> or with <hi>others:</hi> the third by <hi>himſelfe,</hi> or by <hi>accident;</hi> and <hi>agere</hi> is giuen to euery one of theſe. Let vs then ſee where Gods action in ſinne comes in: and becauſe it is moſt apparent in the third; I anſwer, God is the cauſe of ſin by accident: And this will appeare, if we conſider how many cauſes wrought by an internal principle; &amp; theſe were foure: the <hi>deuill,</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> principally; the <hi>ſerpent,</hi> and the <hi>woman</hi> inſtrumentally; and all theſe were blameable cauſes. The <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall</hi> cauſe was the lawe, and will of God; which in mans tranſgreſſion, did all they did by an <hi>externall facultie:</hi> for the lawe is made the <hi>ſauour of death vnto death,</hi> not by his own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, but by the deuills and mans free will: and this work of the law was moſt holy and iuſt. And this is a working cauſe, iuſtified by the true rule of reaſon, and not a bare permiſſion. If a man take a knife, and thruſt it into his bowels, it is the cauſe of murder, and no permiſſion: if man therfore was thruſt tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and wounded to the death by the law of God, it was no
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:21235:75"/>bare permiſſion, but a working cauſe, yet in all things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable. And therefore to denie Gods will all cauſation, is impoſſible. If a man would faine kill himſelfe, and could finde no inſtrument to effect it withall, he would be kept from the fact for want thereof: ſo if the Law had not bin, man could not haue died. Therefore it is moſt true, when our Diuines ſpeake of permiſſion, that they doe not in the <hi>generall latitude of action,</hi> exclude it from comming vnder that Generall head, which <hi>Arminius</hi> doth in euery place, and ſo takes all manner of working from God in ſinne.</p>
                  <p>For that which hee obiects of <hi>prudence,</hi> it is true,
<note place="margin">The ſiue intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall vertue.</note> that this vertue is a ſpeciall one: for firſt, we define <hi>intelligence,</hi> that vertue whereby God vnderſtandeth euery particular, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning euery thing. 2. his <hi>knowledge</hi> or <hi>ſcience,</hi> whereby he knoweth all truths in things; as it is of things to come, it is called his foreknowledge, or preſcience. 3. his <hi>ſapience,</hi> whereby he knoweth whatſoeuer may follow, or enſue of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing. 4. his <hi>prudence,</hi> whereby he knoweth his fitteſt opportunitie for all things. 5. his <hi>skill,</hi> whereby he knoweth to effect euery thing moſt skilfully. The firſt of theſe <hi>vertues,</hi> belongs to all kinds of reaſon, which we call <hi>arguments</hi> ſimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered in <hi>inuention:</hi> the 2. is ſeene in <hi>axiomes,</hi> where all truths are contained; the 3. in <hi>ſyllogiſmes,</hi> that teacheth how to conclude out of truths knowne; the 4. is ſeene in <hi>method</hi> and <hi>order;</hi> the 5. in <hi>practiſe.</hi> Hence we obſerue, that theſe 5. vertues beeing diſtinguiſhed, yet one by a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> may be put for all. And therefore when <hi>M. Perkins</hi> ſaies <hi>prudently,</hi> he vnderſtands, not onely Gods <hi>orderly proceeding,</hi> but <hi>intelligence</hi> of all things, <hi>ſcience</hi> of all truths, <hi>wiſdome</hi> in all diductions, and the moſt <hi>skilfull handling</hi> of the matter that poſſibly can be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined. For the third, it is but a meere <hi>Grammaticall enaſion:</hi> for <hi>M. Perkins</hi> meant no more but the ende it ſelfe, though he further added the application of it. For the fourth, God nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wills, nor decrees that which he cannot; is no imperfect ſenſe, ſeeing that God, <hi>fecit qua potuit, &amp; quafecit &amp; potuit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crevit,</hi> that is, God did it, as he could doe it, and as he did it, and could doe it, he decreed it. And therefore there was no
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:21235:76"/>neede of ſuch addition, ſeeing that Gods <hi>poſſe</hi> brings in his <hi>officere,</hi> and that <hi>poſſe</hi> and <hi>efficere</hi> bring in his decree. But I ſee if I ſhould follow him ſteppe by ſteppe, his acuteneſſe would make me heape vp an infinite writing; therefore I content my ſelfe with a generall view of him, becauſe a iuſt confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him ought to be in an other ſtyle. Therefore that I may onely free the point in hand, I will generally labour to doe it in the maine points, and leaue the other to ſome more ſpeciall tractate hereafter.</p>

<note place="margin">God decree man table, graunted of both, yet <hi>Arminius</hi> by permiſſion, and occaſion taken, oppoſeth M. <hi>Perkins.</hi>
                     </note> Principle: Gods decree is <hi>immutable,</hi> euen in thoſe things which are <hi>mutable.</hi> This is confeſſed of <hi>Arminius,</hi> both in Gods decree of effectuall working, and permiſſion: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret oppoſition lies in two things, firſt in that he exactly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth betwixt to doe, and permit, and will graunt no efficiencie to permiſſion: which beeing defended, ouerturnes the nature of a decree: for if to permit, be to doe nothing; then God ſhould decree to doe nothing. If he anſwer, to doe ſome thing in himſelfe, but nothing in mans ſinne, then God ſhould decree ſome thing with himſelfe, which ſhould neuer be effected in the creature by himſelfe, &amp; ſo God ſhould not perfect his owne will. But it may further be replied, God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees to permit,
<note place="margin">Permiſſiion yeelds the creature his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, ver de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies not God his worke in ſinne.</note> that is, to giue the creature free libertie to fall into ſinne: this is true permiſſion, that God will not doe it himſelfe, but permit man to doe it; yet ſtill we are further to adde, that the wiſdom of God, which is his will reuealed in his law, did worke in the very ſinne: and therefore ſinne is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the law, not by any <hi>internall facultie</hi> or power in the law, but externall; which beeing <hi>accidentall,</hi> is alwaies redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to other cauſes: and therefore the laſt reſolution of ſinne, is into the free will of man. For neither the abuſe of the law by the deuiil, or his temptation, had prooued ſinnes in man, except he had conioyned with them. Secondly, though Gods decree in both theſe be immutable, yet God follows the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in taking occaſion from him in his greateſt mutations to ſet forth his glorie. This cannot ſtand: for <hi>immutabilitie</hi> makes a neceſſarie truth, and all neceſſarie truths are eternall: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taken from no occaſion of ſuch things as ſhould be in
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:21235:76"/>time, which are <hi>mutable</hi> and <hi>contingent,</hi> and neuer to be the grounds of eternall truths, which onely haue their originall from him that is <hi>immutable</hi> and <hi>eternall;</hi>

                        </gap> contingent, and therefore an immutable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree cannot be vpon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God, creatures.</note> and therefore before all occaſions, are conſidered: for it is impoſſible, either that Gods <hi>will,</hi> or the <hi>decree</hi> of his will, or the <hi>immutabilitie</hi> of that decree, or the <hi>neceſſarie truth</hi> from that immutabilitie, ſhould euer be vpon occaſion taken from creatures <hi>mutable</hi> and <hi>changeable.</hi> For whatſoeuer follows vpon contingent things, is contingent; and therefore if Gods decree ſhould follow vpon contingent things, it would become contingent.</p>
                  <p>Indeed there is a <hi>connexion</hi> or <hi>diſiunction</hi> of contingent things which is neceſſarie, not from the contingent things themſelues, but either from the connexion or diſiunction it ſelfe. As for example; if thou beleeue, thou ſhalt be ſaued, the connexion is neceſſarie; but that thou ſhould <hi>beleeue,</hi> or be <hi>ſaued,</hi> are both contingent. A man is either <hi>learned</hi> or <hi>vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> is a neceſſarie diſiunction; but that thou ſhould be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is contingent; and ſo is the other. If God decree, then it muſt come to paſſe; but if the decree, ſhould follow vpon the thing come to paſſe, though but occaſionally, yet would it croſſe the nature of immutabilitie. And we graunt him that which he ſaies, that the tearmes of the creatures mutation, which make a moſt certen determination, and by connexion, a neceſſarie truth: yet in ſimple conſideration, the Lord might haue done otherwiſe: which neuer can be in a neceſſarie truth.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Principle: All Gods iudgments are to be <hi>honoured</hi> &amp; <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged. Exception:</hi> if they will agree with the <hi>word</hi> of God, and his <hi>iuſtice:</hi> and this cannot be, except they be inflicted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on man ſinfull: a iuſt exception, but not againſt the principle: for three things are to be conſidered in man: firſt, his <hi>worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip,</hi> and that is Gods: ſecondly, the <hi>appointment</hi> of it for vſe vnto his maker: thirdly, what may follow vpon <hi>fault</hi> of the veſſell. Men are <hi>veſſels,</hi> and ſo they are Gods; ſecondly, they are <hi>prepared</hi> of God for his vſe: but the third, that they are <hi>veſſels of wrath,</hi> that is of themſelues. Therefore <hi>Auguſtine</hi> would not man to diſpute with God, either for his making, or
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:21235:77"/>for the ende of his making: for this can be reſolued into no higher a cauſe then his owne will. But if he will diſpute with God, for his wrath and vengeance executed vpon him, he ſhal find no other <hi>meritorious cauſe,</hi> but his ſinns. That he ſaies <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> was too bold with the place to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Arminius</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> of raſhneſſe, yet <hi>bona venia,</hi> with greater raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> ſeeing the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> intended no ſuch thing as <hi>humane infirmitie</hi> to diſpute with God, but to muſle vp the mouthes of the <hi>refractorie</hi> and <hi>peruerſe Iewes,</hi> and ſuch like: but yet he is to know, that if the Apoſtle had brought his argument to that purpoſe onely, then ſhould he haue dealt with them, as our Sauiour Chriſt did, Ioh. 8. the Iewes they ſay, we haue no neede to be made free; Chriſt tels them, <hi>Ye are the ſeruants of ſinne;</hi> &amp; therefore in vaine doe you boaſt of your freedom: ſo here the <hi>Iewes</hi> might haue ſaide, we are caſt off and <hi>reprobates,</hi> for ſo was the will of God, and how ſhould we haue helped it? The Apoſtle might preſently haue ſtopped their mouthes, Yee are <hi>rebells</hi> againſt God, and therefore he hath caſt you off: what could fleſh and blood haue oppoſed to this? But the Apoſtle makes no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this, but reſolues all into Gods will, and that moſt iuſtly; ſeeing to make and prepare his veſſells, is his own will alone. When he ſhall come to the third, to handle them as veſſels of wrath, the cauſe ſhall eaſily be found out, to iuſtifie God and condemne man.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Principle: No mon can doe any thing, but where God workes the will and the deed: and it is done, according to that meaſure, <hi>leſſe</hi> or <hi>more,</hi> that God beſtowes vpon vs. Of the concourſe of Gods grace, both of them agree, onely that word <hi>abſolute</hi> is diſliked; yet if in all effects the firſt cauſe bee abſolutely required, that the ſecond may worke, then God muſt abſolutely concurre to the effecting of any good.</p>
                  <p>Seuenth principle: No euill is avoided, that God doth not keepe vs from in the working. Of this it is agreed; but the manner of working is doubted of: whether it bee by <hi>omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie,</hi> cauſing a <hi>neceſſary impedition;</hi> or of <hi>counſell,</hi> cauſing an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible impedition:</hi> the firſt mooues the will naturally, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond voluntarily. To anſwer, the diſtinction is not good: for omnipotencie goes along with prouidence, in the <hi>preſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:21235:77"/>of the creature, as well as it did in <hi>creation</hi> for the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the ſame; and therefore omnipotencie is ſeen in the creatures motions, whether <hi>naturall,</hi> or <hi>voluntarie.</hi> Secondly, that diſtinction of the wills naturall motion, and voluntary, is falſe: for I demaund, whether the will in both be an internall <hi>agent?</hi> if internall, then it ſuffers neither violence nor coacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but acts moſt freely, and therefore by that <hi>modus efficiendi,</hi> which is counſell. Thirdly, a neceſſarie impedition, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, are not alwaies diſtinguiſhed; nay a neceſſarie impediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is alwaies infallible, though infallible be not alwaies neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie: and therefore to make diſtribution of a <hi>whole</hi> into a <hi>part,</hi> and a <hi>whole,</hi> is againſt reaſon, and oppoſeth thoſe which are not oppoſed. Fourthly, the <hi>naturall</hi> or <hi>voluntarie motion</hi> of the will to an <hi>externall obiect,</hi> is neuer neceſſarie, but contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. Therefore if the Lord ſhould mooue the will, with a moſt <hi>certaine determination,</hi> vpon ſome externall obiect, it ſhould not make the act neceſſarie.</p>
                  <p>Eigth Principle: Gods will is iudged of by his <hi>word,</hi> by <hi>reuelation,</hi> and by <hi>euent. Arminius</hi> excepts againſt the third, becauſe the euent may as wel belong to Gods permiſſion of it, as his action in it: the former teacheth vs to reſolue the euent <hi>affirmatiuely</hi> vpon the ſecond cauſe, but <hi>negatiuely</hi> vpon Gods will; becauſe he would not hinder it, either by his power, <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum modum naturae,</hi> or perſwaſion, <hi>ſecundum modum volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis liberae.</hi> If wee graunt that God permitted ſinne (which before I haue ſhewed to bee falſe, in regard that a manner of working in ſinne is iuſtified of God without all blame) yet doth it not follow, but that the euent ſhould be Gods: Zach. 6.1. the <hi>foure charets of the world,</hi> that is, all euents, <hi>Eaſt, Weſt, North,</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> come from betweene <hi>mountaines of braſſe,</hi> Gods immutable decree, which is as immooueable as a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of braſſe. Againe, that God muſt needes will the euent, it is plaine from the order of his wiſedome, which runnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after all euents: before to worke in them, and diſpoſe of them; without which two cauſes they cannot bee: he that is the firſt wiſedome, and the laſt, will not ſuffer any euent that ſhall not be from him, to him; for in as much as any thing
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:21235:78"/>is to him, in ſo much it is from him, ſeeing it is equally good to both, that is, as good for God, ſo good from God. Now ſurely, all euents fall between theſe two tearmes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from God to God. Againe, as after the euent, Gods wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doth either <hi>approoue</hi> or <hi>diſprooue</hi> of the ſecond cauſes working it: and hence all euents are either <hi>ordered, limited,</hi> or <hi>puniſhed</hi> of God.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Principle: No man can doe that good which he might doe by grace, except God ſhould worke in him both the <hi>will,</hi> and the <hi>deede</hi> to effect the ſame. To this <hi>Arminius</hi> replies, that God neuer giues power, but ſecondly all things that might concurre to bring that power into act. This is moſt true; for before we ſhewed, that two things were required to produce any worke; facultie, and rule of working; and God neuer put any facultie into his creature, but he gaue him a ſufficient rule to worke by. But the ſtrait tying together of theſe two, makes the creature to ſtand firme and immooueable: therefore <hi>religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (which ſince the fall is <hi>properly</hi> ſo called) a tying againe of man vnto God, is this <hi>ſtrait bond,</hi> that ties the faithfull ſoule for euer vnto God; <hi>I will put my feare into their hearts, and they ſhall neuer depart from me: This is eternall life to knowe thee, &amp;c.</hi> So then, beſide the rule, and the facultie, a third thing is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, not for ſufficiencie of working, but for certentie of working, and that is, when the Lord ſhall put into vs his <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace, which ſhall lead vs into all truth,</hi> and keepe vs from falling away. And this third thing <hi>Adam</hi> wanted, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Phil. 2.13. <hi>It is God which worketh in you both the will &amp; the deede, euen at his good pleaſure:</hi> Obſerue, firſt it is ſaid in <hi>you,</hi> that is, his faithfull ones: ſecondly, it is both will and deede: thirdly, it is his moſt free will and pleaſure, and therefore hee may doe it to whom he will, and when he will: therefore man had power and rule ſufficient to haue ſtood, but God did not ſo neceſſarily tie theſe together, but that man might, if hee pleaſed, denie his concourſe with the rule, and ſo ſinne againſt God.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Principle: The <hi>gouernement</hi> of the whole world, and all <hi>execution</hi> of iuſtice, is to be aſcribed vnto God. The exception
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:21235:78"/>to this is of ſmall moment; God doth all not onely in iuſtice, but alſo in mercie, and knowes where to beſtow both: this M. <hi>Perkins</hi> included in the gouernment of the world, wherein both iuſtice and mercie are manifeſted.</p>

                     <p>For the ſecond, The <hi>ſubiect</hi> of Predeſtination is of man <hi>qua peccator,</hi> as ſinnefull: and in this <hi>Arminius</hi> doth triumph, as the only ground whereby he ouerturnes all other opinions of predeſtination; ſo that if we be able to diſcouer an other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of Predeſtination, the cauſe wil eaſily be euicted in all the reſt.

                     <p>The moſt ſpeciall ſubiect that can be imagined,
<note place="margin">The firſt ſubiect in reſolution which is laſt in compoſition,</note> is one <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiduall</hi> and <hi>ſingular</hi> man; and in this regard men are ſaid either to be <hi>written</hi> or <hi>blotted out</hi> of Gods booke, that is, either cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by name, or put out by name; as in a <hi>regiſter,</hi> wherein men are intitled vnto ſome honour, he that brags of it, and yet when the regiſter is ſearched, hath not his name therein, is put to greater ſhame: and this book is called in the Scriptures, <hi>the booke of life,</hi> wherein God is ſaid to write and blot out mens names; not that any is blotted out, but that God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts that he neuer had them in his election. And this is made of <hi>Arminius</hi> his fourth and laſt decree, wherein he inſerts two moſt vncomfortable points: Firſt, that the <hi>baſis</hi> and <hi>foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of this, is nothing but Gods <hi>foreknowledge</hi> in the vſe of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient meanes adminiſtred; which beeing receiued and kept, men ſhould be ſaued;

Secondly, though by <hi>preuenting grace,</hi> men might beleeue, and by <hi>ſubſequent grace</hi> perſeuere, yet he might looſe both, and of a beleeuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come no beleeuer; which firſt of all breakes in peices the chaine, Rom. 8.3. the conſequent of iuſtification is glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: this is contradicted by <hi>Arminius:</hi> a man may be iuſtified,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:21235:79"/>that neuer ſhall be glorified: for I am ſure, he that beleeues, is iuſtified; yet he that beleeues, may fall from grace: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man may be iuſtified, that neuer ſhall be glorified. But the Apoſtle ſaies the contrarie, <hi>Whome he hath iuſtified, them alſo he hath glorified.</hi> Againe, it breakes the next linke: for God calls all, ſeeing he giues meanes ſufficient to know and beleeue; and therefore effectuall meanes are vſed, whereby men are called, yet neuer ſhall be iuſtified: when the Apoſtle ſaies the contrarie, <hi>whome he calls effectually and ſufficiently, they are iuſtified.</hi> So then, a man may be called, but neuer iuſtified; and iuſtified, but neuer glorified.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it makes againſt our redemption: Ioh. 10.27. <hi>My ſheepe heare my voice, and follow me, &amp;c.</hi> Here he contradicts three maine things in v. 28. Firſt, eternall life; he that beleeues hath it; but he may looſe it; therefore eternall life, may ſuffer death, and ſo eternall ſhould become temporall, and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall mortall. Secondly, <hi>they ſhall neuer periſh;</hi> a good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent from eternall life: yet <hi>Arminius</hi> contradicts it, and ſaies, Chriſts ſheepe may periſh. Thirdly, <hi>No man ſhall plucke them out of his hand:</hi> but they may fall, ſaies <hi>Arminius,</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall they be taken from him: but he will ſay, it is of themſelues: but that makes the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradiction much the worſe. For then, 1. Chriſts ſheepe may not <hi>heare</hi> his voice. 2. Chriſt may not <hi>know</hi> them. 3. they may not <hi>follow</hi> him. 4. they may extinguiſh that life, for which they are content to looſe their <hi>naturall life:</hi> and their <hi>eternall life</hi> may be as ſubiect to caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as their mortall and miſerable life. 5. they that ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer periſh, may periſh of themſelues; therefore Chriſt ſhall not be as good as his word, that ſaid <hi>neuer.</hi> 6. Chriſt ſhall fuffer that of his owne, which he would neuer permit vnto others; and therefore ſhould be weaker to oppoſe the <hi>violence</hi> of his owne, then the <hi>tyrannie</hi> of others. 7. his fathers gift, and greatneſſe ſhall be ſurpriſed; his Gift committed to the truſt of his Sonne, ſhall not faithfully be reſtored, and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is greater then all, though he ſhall preuaile againſt all others, yet his owne ſhall ouercome him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it takes away all Chriſtian confidence; how durſt
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:21235:80"/>Paul ſo triumph,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.31.</note> challenge <hi>principalities</hi> and <hi>powers?</hi> Paul ſaies, <hi>If God be for vs, who ſhall be againſt vs?</hi> Why Paul, thou may be againſt thy ſelfe: <hi>God ſpared not his Son to giue vs àll things;</hi> yet Paul he gaue vs not perſeuerance. <hi>Who can charge Gods choſen?</hi> who? Paul there is an anſwer; They can do it theſelues. <hi>God iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth, who ſhall condemne?</hi> The anſwer is eaſie; they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn themſelues. <hi>Chriſt is dead, yea rather riſen, &amp; makes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion:</hi> but Paul, for all his dying, we may die; for all his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, we may riſe to condemnation; &amp; for all his interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we may liue not onely in purgatorie, but hell it ſelfe. But to ſtoppe the mouthes of ſuch diſputers, the Apoſtle in the 35.38, 39. makes an ennumeration of all that can befall vs; as <hi>tribulation, anguiſh, perſecution, famine, nakednes, perill, ſword, death, life, angels, principalities, powers, things preſent, things to come, height, depth, or any other thing:</hi> and what more then theſe can be found. If thy ſelfe be more then all theſe, then thou art aſſuredly a moſt wretched perſon, that when all is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away that might draw thee from Chriſt, then thou wilt draw away thy ſelfe: what more deſperate then this? <hi>In all theſe things,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>we are more then conquerours:</hi> and how ſhould more then conquerers, be conquered? and they that are thus perſwaded not in themſelues, but in him that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them, euer turne this their perſwaſion into miſerable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire. And thus much of the loweſt ſteppe in Predeſtination.</p>

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:21235:80"/>God, according to <hi>Arminius,</hi> which he calls abſolute and preciſe,

To <hi>beleeuers</hi> and <hi>penitent,</hi> God giues ſaluation in Chriſt, for Chriſt and by Chriſt; but impenitent and infidels damnation, as ſtrangers from Chriſt. You are to vnderſtand, that this decree is preciſe, in regard of faith, and not of the perſon: for he may denie the faith, and become an infidell, and ſo be damned. And here againe he offers violence to the faith of Gods Elect, againſt which Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>The gates of hell ſhal neuer preuaile.</hi> And thus by analyſing, by the way, we haue diſcouered two of <hi>Arminius</hi> decrees, with the falſhoods therein contained.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Subiect more generall then both theſe, is the Church:
<note place="margin">Eccleſia <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 chunk">
                              <desc>…</desc>

                           <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zanijs.</note> and here is the proper place, of the manifeſtation of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. The Church conſiſts of <hi>mon,</hi> and <hi>angels:</hi> and ſo both men and angels, are the ſubiect of Gods decree; Reprobation, the manifeſtation of his hatred, both vpon men and angels, which are excluded from the true ſocietie and communion that is in his Church: Election, the true declaration of his loue, both vpon men and angels, which he hath receiued into communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with himſelfe vnder Chriſt Ieſus the head of the Church. I muſt deſcend a little in this, that I may diſcouer a third decree of <hi>Arminius,</hi> which onely belongs vnto this place; but yet I am not come to the ſpeciall head of it. The Church is <hi>militant,</hi> or <hi>triumphant:</hi> for the triumphant Church, in which God hath manifeſted his election, as wel as the militant, conſiſts of ſaints and Angels. Here then obſerue, that ſinne and miſerie, do not goe before election, and reprobation: for ſo ſhould they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the whole ſubiect, and euery member of the ſame; but ſinne and miſcrie, agrees not vnto the holy angels,
<note place="margin">Angels elect in the Church, and yet neuer miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</note> and yet they are elect: now as many as were elect, could not fall into the ſinne of apoſtacie, and therefore the reſt were not ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; if not elected, then reiected in Gods decree, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they fell; and therefore reiection before ſinne. But to deſcend to the Church militant, which is with the tares; firſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> election and reprobation appeared in <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel:</hi> in <hi>Abraham,</hi> in <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac:</hi> in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> in <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau:</hi>
                        <pb n="144" facs="tcp:21235:81"/>in <hi>Iacob,</hi> called Iſrael, the true <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, and the <hi>fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeede:</hi> and now in the time of the Goſpel, here and there as it pleaſeth God to reueale his will and counſell, which long before was ſet down with himſelfe: and for the gathering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of his Church here vpon earth, he hath left means ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. And here comes in the third decree of <hi>Arminus,</hi> that God hath left in his Church ſufficient, neceſſarie, and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all meanes, to bring men to faith and repentance. And this we graunt, onely we deſire that theſe meanes may be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as onely reſting in the boſome of the Church, where God hath laid open the riches of his treaſuries, and onely to bee effectuall where Chriſt will apply them by the gratious worke of his ſpirit: for the Church is not compounded of tares and wheat: but the militant Church is wheate with tares; as the ſores of a bodie, are not the part of a bodie, but with the bodie, and all <hi>cures</hi> are applyed for the <hi>bodie</hi> againſt the <hi>ſores:</hi> and ſo all theſe meanes are for the welfare of his <hi>Church,</hi> but againſt the <hi>tares;</hi> and the meanes are applied to both, to the one for ſaluation, but to the other for damnation. 2. Tim. 2.19. <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> haue erred concerning the truth, and meanes of their ſaluation: this might make weake Chriſtians ſtagger, but the Apoſtle takes away all theſe doubts, <hi>the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of God remaineth ſure, and hath this ſeale, The Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth who are his:</hi> and therefore wil apply theſe meanes onely ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, to his owne; for that opinion of vniuerſall grace is damnable: <hi>greater loue then this hath no man, to lay downe his life, &amp;c.</hi> If then he haue laid downe his life for the wicked, he hath no greater loue for his own, then he hath for the damned: &amp; if Gods iuſtice be ſatisfied for the wicked, how ſhould he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them? and if Chriſt died for them, then God wil acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a ſatisfaction. But they ſay, all the fault is for want of application: To this I anſwer, that applicetion is as neceſſary an effect of redemption, as burning is of the fire; and there can be no redemption, but of neceſſitie it muſt bring in appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: firſt, in regard of Gods iuſtice, which being appeaſed, cannot but be reconciled to all thoſe offenders, with whome he is well pleaſed in his ſonne. Secondly, in regard of Chriſts
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:21235:81"/>ſacrifice, Dan. 9.24. <hi>Meſſiah muſt bee ſlaine to reconcile the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, and bring in euerlaſting righteouſnes:</hi> this cannot be done without application, for both iuſtification and reconciliation belong to application. Thirdly, in regard of beleeuers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues who are his members, and therefore cannot be without the deriuation of grace, from their head Chriſt Ieſus.</p>

Here comes in redemption, which is in nature before application, either to the Church, or faithfull: and therefore going backeward, we come moſt orderly vnto it in the next place; and here ſhall we finde <hi>Arminius</hi> building vp his firſt decree; and hauing detected him here,

The third decree is to be found in the Church militant; &amp; that is, <hi>Volo omnia media ad reſipiſcentia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; fidem neceſſaria, ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, adminiſtrare, &amp;c.</hi> I will decree all meanes neceſſarie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and faith, and ſufficiently and effectually adminiſter them, &amp;c. Fourth and laſt is of euerie ſingular perſon, which belongs to the opening of the books at the day of iudgment, ſpeciall or generall: and this is all that he can ſay for Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. And becauſe wee are come to his firſt decree, which is that which he preſſeth in all his book, we wil ſhew that when he hath preſſed all his arguments, he prooues no more, then Chriſt to be the cauſe of redemption, but none of election.</p>
                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:21235:82"/>
                     <p> Epheſ. 1.4. <hi>Elegit nos in Chriſto,</hi> he choſe vs in Chriſt: v. 6. he accepted of vs in his beloued: Rom. 8.39. 2. Cor. 5.16. the argument is framed thus; If God can will any to haue eternall life, without reſpect of a mediator; then can he giue eternall life without ſatisfaction of a mediator; but this is impoſſible. Secondly, if God can loue no man but in Chriſt, then can hee elect no man but in Chriſt; for he elects none but thoſe which he loues. Theſe and all other places concerning Chriſt, &amp; the redeemed in Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Chriſt a meanes of election, but a principall cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</note> are thus to be anſwered: Chriſt is either conſidered as a <hi>means</hi> appointed of God, or as a <hi>principle</hi> and proper cauſe: in the firſt he is ſubordinate: in the ſecond, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame: as a meanes appointed of God, ſo he is ſubordinate to Gods decree of election: and therefore neither as cauſe, nor meanes, nor condition, goes before the decree: but as Chriſt is conſidered in redemption, he is the principall, ſupream, and maine cauſe of all that come within the limits of redemption: we are choſen in Chriſt, not to be elected, but redemed; not as the cauſe of election, but as meanes appointed of God in our election; yet a meritorius cauſe of our ſaluation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: ſo then it is moſt true, that God elects no man but in Chriſt, loues, ſaues and redeemes no man but by Chriſt: in the one, the cauſe; in the other, the effect. So then election can not preſuppoſe faith in Chriſt, remiſſion of ſinnes by Chriſt, renouation of the ſpirit, and perpetuall aſſiſtance, becauſe they follow election, the cauſe of redemption, and redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the cauſe of all theſe. So then while Arminius diſputes his decree in redemption, he commits theſe errors: firſt, he makes the cauſe to follow the effect, as election to follow redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſecondly, he makes Chriſts loue in redeeming, to be the cauſe of Gods loue in electing: thirdly, he makes the meanes appointed for the ende, to goe before the end it ſelfe: fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hee makes the fruits of redemption, as faith, remiſſion of ſinnes, renouation by the ſpirit, perſeuerance, &amp;c. occaſions antecedent, to Gods decree of election. So that theſe ſhalbe no fruits of our election; which if he graunt on the contrarie, then muſt they as occaſions follow our election: for the fruit is no wayes before his cauſe, neither any occaſion why the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:21235:82"/>cauſe ſhould produce them: fiftly, though he denie it, yet he muſt confeſſe that theſe occaſions as they are holden of him, muſt be cauſes for Gods decree to ſaue vs by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by <hi>faith,</hi> by <hi>repentance,</hi> by <hi>remiſſion of ſinnes,</hi> by <hi>renouation,</hi> by <hi>perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> in weldoing: what are theſe but cauſes of eternall life? I am ſure ſaluation is giuen vnto Chriſt as a <hi>meritorious cauſe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Arminius for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets him ſelfe when he ſaies we are choſen in Chriſt as a meritorious cauſe, for ſo his occaſion at vn<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares ſlips into a cauſe.</note> &amp; ſo in Chriſt to all the reſt. Theſe then going before Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection to left and ſaluation, can no wayes be conſidered, but as cauſes: and indeed his words ſound ſo much, when he ſaies, <hi>we are choſen in Chriſt,</hi> not as a meanes, but alſo as a <hi>meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cauſe;</hi> of what effect I beſeech you? if he ſay of <hi>redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> then we are all of one mind; but if he ſay of <hi>election,</hi> then we reiect him: but his meaning is, we are choſen in Chriſt, as a meritorious cauſe of that choice, and ſo the occaſion was not taken from thence, but the true and onely cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Many other abſurdities followe from this, but I paſſe them ouer: and yet before I aſcend to the next ſtep, let me tell you how <hi>Arminius</hi> contradicts himſelfe: Firſt, hee ſaies, that the ſubiect of <hi>election</hi> is man fallen: but how can that be, ſeeing no men are elected before they be in Chriſt? I am ſure that he dare not denie, but that they were ſinners before they were in Chriſt, and therefore they were elected before they were ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. Secondly, he ſaies, that we are elected in Chriſt as a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer;</hi> and yet Chriſt is a redeemer before we be in him, for application followes redemption. Againe, both man fallen, &amp; man to be redeemed are all alike, and Chriſt is equall to all, where then is election? Thirdly, a man muſt be in the <hi>Church,</hi> before he can be of the number of the faithfull, and vntil he be faithfull he cannot be elected, therefore election comes after the fall, redemption, and the Church. Fourthly, a <hi>faithfull</hi> man may fall, and ſo election may change, and therefore no certaine election but of <hi>ſingular perſons.</hi> Thus then the firſt ſubiect of <hi>election</hi> that he can finde, is either a <hi>faithfull perſon</hi> or a <hi>ſingular perſon:</hi> ſo that it is lower then the Church, redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the fall.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:21235:83"/>for election or reprobation, yet the proper ſubiect by his doctrine cannot be found out, vntill we come to the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a man as a <hi>beeleeuer</hi> or an <hi>infidel:</hi> neither here is it fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but it muſt skip againe to a ſingular perſon: for ſaith hee, that former decree is rather <hi>qualitatum</hi> then <hi>perſonarum,</hi> of qualities then perſons: ſo that he is vncertaine in all his noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Homo peccator</hi> the fift ſtep in aſcending.</note> is man fallen: where God ſhewes theſe attributes: Firſt, his <hi>holineſſe,</hi> in that the Lord was free from all fault: Secondly, his <hi>iuſtice,</hi> whereby he beeing moſt iuſt in himſelfe, cannot but execute iuſtice: as in wel-doing to them which doe well; ſo in inflicting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on them which do ill: as it burnes more remiſſely againſt ſinne, it is called <hi>anger;</hi> as more ſharpely, <hi>wrath;</hi> as it doth giue ſentence, <hi>iudgement,</hi> as it doth execute, <hi>vengeance.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he ſhewes <hi>mercie,</hi> not that which is properly vnderſtood in Chriſt: but that which is vnderſtood in my text, <hi>compaſſion, gentleneſſe, patience, longanimitie, bountifulneſſe,</hi> &amp;c. and theſe moſt properly appeare in the fall: yet the fall beeing more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall then all that follow, hath his vſe in them all, and is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate with all the reſt to the decree of God. And euen here God manifeſts his decree of election, euen before the ſending of Chriſt: Ioh. 3.16. <hi>God ſo loued the world, that he hath giuen his onely begotten Sonne, that whoſoeuer beleeueth in him, ſhould not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life.</hi> 1. Ioh. 4.9. <hi>In this appeared the loue of God toward vs, becauſe God ſent, &amp;c.</hi> in both theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the loue of God is the cauſe why Chriſt was giuen and ſent; and therefore this loue went before Chriſt, elſe ſhould the cauſe followe the effect; this loue was decreed. So then, God loued the world, before he either gaue or ſent his Son: <hi>actually</hi> he loues none but in Chriſt, neither doth any feele his loue, but he that is in Chriſt: and therefore for the comfort of the Church, the fitteſt place to teach the decree in, is <hi>applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of Chriſt; yet the determination of his loue, was before all this, and the onely cauſe why Chriſt was ſent into the world.</p>

                     <p>Now I come vnto the end:
<note place="margin">Concerning the third thing in the definition which is about the ende.</note> where I wil ſhew three things: firſt the end it ſelfe; ſecondly, the manifeſtation of it; thirdly, the order. The end, on all parts is graunted, to be Gods glory: for as he is the <hi>ſupreame efficient cauſe</hi> of all things, ſo is he the <hi>laſt end;</hi> and before him, and after him, nothing is to be found. Secondly, all agree, that the manifeſtation muſt be in regard of his <hi>eſſentiall properties;</hi> only all the queſtion is of the laſt, in what order they are to be manifeſted. That this may appeare, we will ſhew what the <hi>order</hi> of endes is:
<note place="margin">Subordination of ends to ſome laſt.</note> ſecondly, which ende is <hi>exactly the laſt</hi> in this order: thirdly, the order of the <hi>meanes:</hi> fourthly, the order of <hi>ſubiects,</hi> out of which, theſe meanes are produced. Order of ends, is the <hi>ſubordination,</hi> or bringing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of all ends to one laſt ende: the reaſon of this is, becauſe order is alwaies of things comming betwixt an <hi>abſolute firſt,</hi> and an <hi>abſolute laſt:</hi> this the heathen Philoſophers called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>eruditio in cinculo,</hi> wiſdome run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning round in a <hi>circle.</hi> In a circle you know, that there muſt be the ſame <hi>beginning</hi> and <hi>ending:</hi> ſo God, the beginning and ending of all things, makes his wiſdome in all his creatures runne round from him to him. This the heathen Poet <hi>Homer,</hi> called, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>auream catenam, quae de coelo vſque ad ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram deſcendebat,</hi> a golden chaine, comming from heauen to earth; in which euery footſteppe or impreſſion of Gods wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, is as a <hi>golden lincke,</hi> coupled with ſome-other from the beginning to the ende. So then, the firſt point is plaine, that all things are vnited together for ſome laſt ende. Many lines meete in one <hi>center,</hi> and ſo all make but one; yet being drawn vnto the <hi>circumference,</hi> ſpread themſelues abroad.</p>
                     <p>For the ſecond,
<note place="margin">The laſt end conſiſts in all Gods attributes which are one as himſelfe is one.</note> all Gods <hi>attributes,</hi> are the laſt end; his <hi>glorie</hi> is the laſt, his <hi>goodneſſe</hi> is the laſt, his <hi>vertues</hi> are the laſt, and ſo of the reſt. If it bee inquired which of all theſe wee are to conceiue of, as the laſt exactly; I anſwer, <hi>iuſtice</hi> and <hi>mercie.</hi> This ſhall the better appeare, if we conſider how God is the beſt in euery thing. If we ſpeake of <hi>beeings,</hi> then God is the beſt, and moſt abſolute beeing: if we ſpeake of <hi>life,</hi> then God
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:21235:85"/>is the beſt life: therefore <hi>will</hi> and <hi>vnderſtanding,</hi> which belong vnto the beſt life. Now will and vnderſtanding, are conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of vs, either for <hi>facultie,</hi> or <hi>vertue:</hi> for facultie, then the Lords vnderſtanding beeing the beſt, muſt be able to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand together and at once all truths, and his will moſt free to will all good: facultie we ſay, makes able, but vertue makes prompt and readie; as the <hi>intellectuall vertues</hi> make a man prompt and readie to vnderſtand, the <hi>morall vertues</hi> prompt and readie to wil that which is good. Vertue is whereby God is knowne vnto vs, to be <hi>abſolutely good,</hi> therefore abſolute <hi>happines,</hi> both for vnderſtanding, and will. Theſe beeing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, let vs ſee where we may note the greateſt <hi>perfection</hi> and <hi>excellencie.</hi> Firſt, vertues are more excellent then faculties; and ſo the Lord had rather ſhew his goodneſſe, then his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie. Secondly, morall vertues, are better then intellectuall, in ſo much as the will is better then the vnderſtanding; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I dare boldly ſay, the Lord had rather ſhew his morall vertues, then intellectual:
<note place="margin">The beſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues iuſtice and mercy.</note> for it is a greater praiſe to be <hi>iuſt</hi> and <hi>mercifull,</hi> then <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>vnderſtanding.</hi> Laſtly, among <hi>morall vertues,</hi> none comparable to <hi>iuſtice,</hi> and <hi>mercie:</hi> why then may I not conclude, that exactly the laſt ende that God would haue manifeſted, is <hi>the glorie of his iuſtice and mercie:</hi> and if this be the laſt, then all other muſt be brought vnder theſe, and aime at theſe <hi>principally.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Reaſons of this aſſertion, are many. Firſt, that which brings out of the creature the ſpeciall manifeſtation of Gods glorie, is the laſt and beſt ende; but iuſtice and mercie doe this: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. 33.19. <hi>I will proclaime the Name of the Lord before thee:</hi> and what is eſpecially proclaimed? iuſtice and mercie: and mercie more then iuſtice: ſo, Rom. 9. God will get him a name on <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> a reprobate by his iuſtice; and a name on his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, by his mercie: and therefore God is often ſaid in the Scriptures, to delight himſelfe in iuſtice and mercie.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, iuſtice and mercie, are the chiefe, becauſe they are the vertues of the will, which is properly conuerſant about good. Thirdly, theſe make vs conceiue of God, as the chiefe good. It is worth our obſeruation, to ſee euen how by the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:21235:86"/>light of reaſon, the <hi>Heathen</hi> haue aſcended to this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: they referred all things to foure heads. 1.

Now this <hi>one</hi> once was not, &amp; therefore when it was, it was by the power &amp; force of ſome chiefe and firſt beeing; and this they tearmed <hi>abſolute eſſence:</hi> this beeing alwaies, they tearmed it <hi>eternall eſſence.</hi> Againe, to beeing finding life, the next they called God, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>minde,</hi> or <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi> In the fourth place, becauſe they thought the minde of man to be bare and naked, hauing nothing written in it, yet capable of all things, and therefore imperfect, they called God further, <gap reason="foreign">

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, goodneſſe it ſelfe. 6. Becauſe they thought the chiefe good to be according to all vertues, they gaue vertues vnto God, both <hi>intellectuall</hi> and <hi>morall.</hi> 7. Becauſe vertues were <hi>quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> and ſo comprehended within the limits of <hi>ſubiects,</hi> they called God infinite in <hi>beeing, liuing, vnderſtanding, working, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodnes,</hi> and <hi>infinite vertue.</hi> Now in the 8 place, becauſe infinite vertue muſt be one moſt ſimple vertue, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all in it, they ſaw not how Gods <hi>prouidence,</hi> ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be counted prouidence, then iuſtice; and <hi>iuſtice</hi> rather iuſtice, then mercie; &amp; <hi>mercie</hi> more mercie, then knowledge; <hi>knowledge</hi> then life, and life then <hi>eſſence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>True it is,
<note place="margin">God ſimply one, to vs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe.</note> God is ſimply one in himſelfe, yet apprehended of vs as diuers. For ſo we define him in his attributes; that he is <hi>one God, diuerſly apprehended of vs.</hi> Therefore the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelfe in his creatures, is to be conſidered in diuers heads: yet the greateſt meeting together of all his attributes, is moſt to be ſeene in his iuſtice and mercie. Therefore both Scripture and reaſon, prooue God eſpecially glorified in his iuſtice and mercie. If then iuſtice and mercie, be moſt exactly
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:21235:86"/>the laſt end, then muſt all <hi>ends,</hi> and <hi>meanes,</hi> and <hi>ſubiects,</hi> be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate vnto this ende: and this ende muſt be decreed before all the reſt. Hence we may conclude, that God intended to manifeſt his <hi>iuſtice</hi> and <hi>mercie,</hi> before all things.</p>
                     <p>For the third, the order of the meanes,
<note place="margin">The order of meanes.</note> it muſt thus be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, that that which is firſt in <hi>execution,</hi> is laſt in the <hi>intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the workeman, and moſt remote from the ende; and the lower we goe, the neerer we come vnto the ende. <hi>M. Perkins</hi> makes <hi>creation</hi> and <hi>permiſſion</hi> of the fall, two generall meanes of Gods predeſtination. This Arminius reprehends: for, ſaies he, both creation and the fall, goe before predeſtination: it is true in the execution; but if predeſtination reſt vpon the laſt end, intended of God, it muſt needs goe before as an end, and haue all theſe meanes come vnder him. As for example; I would determine a iourney to <hi>London,</hi> to ſpeake with ſome deare freind; this is before all the meanes that I vſe to come vnto him: yet before I can accompliſh this, I muſt come where he is; and that I may come where he is, I muſt get me a <hi>horſe,</hi> and all things neceſſarie for my iourney: then muſt I goe from <hi>place</hi> to <hi>place,</hi> vntil I come where he is: ſo that the firſt in inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is laſt in execution; and in the progreſſe, the further I goe, the neerer I am to conſider the meanes ſubſequent vnto the end. In like manner, God intends the manifeſtation of his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and mercie; therefore this is the firſt with God, and the laſt, that all meanes driues at. That this may be brought about, God will <hi>create,</hi> create a <hi>world, man</hi> in this world, man <hi>holy,</hi> man holy may by his owne freewill become <hi>vnholy,</hi> man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy may bee <hi>puniſhed</hi> with the iuſtice of God, but <hi>redeemed</hi> may be receiued vnto mercie.</p>

Thirdly, in this world there ſhall be creatures, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to communicate with a <hi>finite good,</hi> or an <hi>infinite good:</hi> in thoſe that communicate with a finite good, God ſhewes his
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:21235:87"/>wonderfull loue to <hi>men</hi> and <hi>angels,</hi> that made all in heauen, and earth for them: ſecondly, with an infinite good, that is, with God himſelfe, as men and angels; where he meant to lay open all the treaſurie of his glorie; goodneſſe, and vertues.

<note place="margin">The vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and will of men and angels are ſpeciall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to declare his goodneſſe.</note> Hence may men and Angels ſhewe forth both his <hi>intellectuall</hi> vertues, and <hi>morall</hi> vertues; they haue <hi>intelligence,</hi> to conceiue of principles; <hi>ſcience,</hi> to iudge of truths; <hi>ſapience,</hi> to make diductions from thoſe truths; <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> to carrie all things orderly; and <hi>art</hi> or skill, to practiſe in any ſubiect the excellencie of their reaſon: Againe, for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vertues, as <hi>compaſſion, gentleneſſe, patience, longanimitie, bountifulneſſe, liberalitie, magnificence, fortitude,</hi> but eſpecially <hi>iuſtice</hi> and <hi>mercy.</hi> So then; in that God made them with holy &amp; righteous vnderſtanding<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>To deſcend firſt to angels:
<note place="margin">Angels ſet forth goodneſſe and iuſtice.</note> God by creation did communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with them infinite goodneſſe, wherein did conſiſt their <hi>happineſſe;</hi> now in reaſon it was neceſſarie, that this commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication ſhould be by <hi>compact, and the ſquare of iuſtice;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a law muſt be giuen them, according to which, this <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication</hi> was to be maintained.

                  <p>It is reported of a <hi>certaine fountaine,</hi> in which a <hi>glaſſe</hi> beeing dipped, and holden before a man ſicke on his bed, if it ſhew him a <hi>deadly face,</hi> then it is a plaine ſigne he muſt die; but if a <hi>cheerefull countenance,</hi> then he is ſure to liue: of the truth of this, I will not diſpute, yet this I am ſure of, take <hi>this glaſſe of the Law,</hi> and dippe it in the <hi>blood of Chriſt,</hi> if it ſhew a <hi>pale face,</hi> then theres no hope of life, becauſe the law ſhewes nothing

Now as a glaſſe helps to order men in the cariage of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues for their bodies among men; ſo the law of God, doth direct and ſhew vnto vs, what courſe we are to take to walke with God. And herein it declares three things.
<note place="margin">The law ſhewes what is comely and vncomely what apparell muſt be put on what off, and then what muſt be our behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</note> Firſt, what is <hi>comely</hi> or <hi>vncomely:</hi> Eph. 5. <hi>To be followers of God as deare children, and walke in loue, as Chriſt hath loued vs,</hi> is a ſeemely thing: but <hi>fornication, vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, couetouſnes, filthines, fooliſh talking, ieſting, &amp;c.</hi> are things not comely, and <hi>rather giuing of thankes,</hi> then the very naming of theſe things <hi>becommeth the Saints.</hi> Secondly, after it hath ſhewed vs what beſeemeth Saints, it teacheth what apparell we muſt off, and what muſt be put on: Eph. 4.22. <hi>The old man, with his whole conuerſation muſt be caſt off, &amp; the new man, which after God is created in righteouſnes and true holines, muſt be put on.</hi> Thirdly, after we haue apparelled our ſelues, it will order the behauiour and carriage of our ſelues, all the daies we haue to liue vpon this mortall earth. Tit. 2.12. <hi>For the grace of God that bringeth ſaluation hath appeared, and teacheth vs to denie all vngodlines, and worldly luſts, and to liue holily, righteouſly, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly in this preſent world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet may we admire, what ſhould be the reaſon that for all this, ſinne is no better ordered. when the Lord hath left vs ſo perfect a law,
<note place="margin">The law no falſe glaſſe.</note> better then all the looking glaſſes in the world: for it tells men moſt truly their <hi>bad faces,</hi> and their <hi>good faces,</hi> it beguiles no man, in making him better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is: nay, it hath a priuiledge aboue all other laws, to wit, many particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, which are as little glaſſes contained in this great glaſſe; wherein men may ſee their owne faces by the face of another. As <hi>good Kings,</hi> may not onely ſee themſelues in Gods law, what is to be done, and left vndone, and what is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of both; but they may ſee themſelues in <hi>Dauid, a man after Gods owne heart, Ioſias, Ezekias,</hi> true reformers of religion: euill Kings, in <hi>Saul, Ieroboam,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes:</hi> good rich men in <hi>Abraham,</hi> euill in <hi>Dives:</hi> ambitious perſons, in <hi>Hammon;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:21235:91"/>Gods law beeing as the ſhining of the ſunne, and his life lead in darknes, he will not to the light, leaſt his workes ſhould be reprooued.</p>

                  <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">4.

One hath <hi>bought a farme,</hi> and he muſt goe ſee it: others a <hi>yoke of oxen,</hi> and they muſt goe trie them: others haue <hi>married a wife,</hi> and they deſire likewiſe to be excuſed. Euery one hath ſomething to doe, to keepe them from God and his law; it were well if they knew how faithfull reckonings, make long friends: and therefore it were very good not to delay the time with God: for he will not be mocked. Chriſt hath ſtood a long time <hi>knocking:</hi> he is ſtanding, if we put off to anſwer, he may ſoone be gone away from vs. We vſe Chriſt as he was v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his birth; no roome for him in the Inne; if he pleaſe, he may haue the <hi>ſtable</hi> and the <hi>manger;</hi> and good reaſon, for great <hi>perſonages</hi> and <hi>vſuall gueſts,</hi> haue taken vp the inner roomes: ſo deale we with our Sauiour, our ſoules are taken vp with great perſonages, as lords and commanders, whome we cannot but obey: as <hi>lord couetouſnes, ambition, pride, ſelfe-loue, pleaſure,</hi> and many vſuall gueſts, with which we haue had great cuſtome, ſo that Chriſt beeing an vnknowne gueſt vnto vs, it may be for meere pitie we will beſtow vpon him our worſt roomes; if he pleaſe to goe into the ſtable, and will not vexe vs in the inner roomes of our ſoules, he ſhall haue a nights lodging, and we

                  <p>Fiftly, diſordered callings take away the ordering of ſinne; as what law can order our <hi>commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beggers, ſtage-players, fidlers,</hi> and ſuch like: ſo many a wretched calling into which men thruſt themſelues, takes away all ordering by Gods lawe, and makes them runne head-long into all ſhame and confuſion: nay further, many callings from God, by the wickedneſſe of mans heart are become exceeding ſinnefull, when indeede Gods callings are all happie orders for our good. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>ſhop-keepers,</hi> they cannot liue except they ſell their wares vpon the Sabbath day; how ſhould Gods lawe order theſe perſons in the ſanctification of the Sabbath? for it is in vaine for that perſon to waſh, which preſently after hee hath waſhed his hands, muſt foule them againe: ſo <hi>Ale wiues,</hi> how ſhould they ſanctifie themſelues, when they are readie to ſerue euery <hi>filthy puddle,</hi> and durtie foule? it is hard to ride with an other in <hi>fowle way</hi> and not be <hi>plaſhed</hi> by him; for one to be at the <hi>mill,</hi> and not to be <hi>duſted;</hi> to touch <hi>pitch,</hi> and not be <hi>defiled;</hi> to carrie burning coales in his boſome, and eſcape the burning.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Eie of reaſon no ſufficient iudge in the matters of ſin.</note> which is the true diſcerner of all Gods works: for God hauing made all for man, he muſt needs giue him an eie, to behold all things that were made for him. By this eie, Adam was able to name the creatures, to knowe their natures, ends, and vſes: this eie ſince the fall is notably bleered; in heauenly things which truely concerne God, hee can ſee nothing at all, becauſe the obiect is too farre diſtant, and cannot be reached vnto by any facultie in him: euen as an aged man can ſee things about him, but to looke afarre off, he is not able, neither can he diſcerne any thing: ſo our aged vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings can ſee ſome things at hand, as what belongs to this eſtate: as hee is a man for ciuill ſocietie, hee can doe ſome morall duties, exerciſe himſelfe in ciuil matters, and labour to maintaine his naturall life. Yet in all theſe his eye is ſo dimme, that he commits many diſorders in them all: for his <hi>morallitie,</hi> ſee how he abuſeth it in the firſt of the Romans: for his <hi>ciuillitie,</hi> ſee how he breaks the legs of iuſtice, &amp; makes him lie in the ſtreets: for ſtrange be the contentions that are in the world betwixt men, to ſupplant one another in their rights, to infringe good titles, and make vp broken: and for this purpoſe, many a lawyer hath euen ſould himſelfe to bee a

The claſpes that doe all this, are in number three: <hi>goodnes,
<note place="margin">Claſpes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. 1. Goodneſſe.</note> ſinne,</hi> and <hi>puniſhment:</hi> Goodneſſe claſps vp the <hi>accuſation</hi> of the <hi>conſcience,</hi> but alwaies leaues open the conſcience for <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation;</hi> therefore a good conſcience will open for no accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, nor ſhut for any vaine excuſations. Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. Sinne.</note> ſinne is either the <hi>claſper</hi> and <hi>vnclaſper</hi> together, or the claſper alone: the claſper and vnclaſper by excuſation or accuſation; as in our firſt parents, it is ſaid, <hi>when they had ſinned, their eyes were opened:</hi> not that they were blind before, but that now the eye had loſt the power of excuſing, and therefore in that was ſhut vp and blinded; but was altogether vnlocked for accuſation and condemning of themſelues: yet by reaſon of cuſtome and long continuance in ſinne, that verie ſelfe ſame thing which opened the eies of our firſt parents, hath wholly ſeared vp the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:21235:94"/>eyes of ſome, that their conſciences neither accuſe nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, except you will ſay they falſly excuſe, when they make vs <hi>cry, peace, peace, and all is well with vs.</hi> Now this for the moſt part, is the claſpe of mens conſciences, ſo that except God bring iudgement, the conſcience will neuer be awaked from his ſecuritie.
<note place="margin">3. Puniſhment.</note> Therefore the third claſpe of the conſcience, is <hi>puniſhment,</hi> &amp; this holds moſt ſurely in excuſation, in ſo much that none can either vnclaſpe it, or by any meanes be able to mitigate the ſtrait holding of puniſhment from all comfort: ſo that neither <hi>angels,</hi> nor <hi>men,</hi> nor any other creature, can giue a dramme of comfort: but for the vnclaſping of the conſcience, it wil do it moſt forcibly, and exceedes all other meanes; and therefore is to bee vnderſtood in this place. Hence ariſeth a fourefold diſtinction of conſcience: the firſt, that is at <hi>peace with it ſelfe,
<note place="margin">Conſcience quiet, but not good. quiet nor good.</note> but not with God;</hi> and that is the conſcience that is wholly locked vp: the ſecond, that is <hi>neither at peace with God nor it ſelfe:</hi> and that is the conſcience vnder the horror of the puniſhment of ſinne:
<note place="margin">good not quiet.</note> the third conſcience, which is <hi>not at peace with it ſelfe, but with God;</hi> and that conſcience hath two claſpes in it, <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> and <hi>ſinne;</hi> goodnes from God, ſin from it ſelfe.
<note place="margin">good and quiet</note> The fourth, <hi>that hath peace with God, and with it ſelfe:</hi> and this is a conſcience that feeles a claſpe of Gods mercie, to bind vp the broken heart, and make it breake forth with ioy, and gladneſſe. So that now if we looke into the world wee ſhall find that euerie man is either a <hi>Prince,</hi> or a <hi>peaſant,</hi> either the <hi>baſeſt</hi> among the ſonnes of men, and moſt <hi>ignoble,</hi> or els couragious as a lyon, and ſtout hearted as a <hi>gyant.</hi> If a man were as poore as <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and as naked as <hi>Iob,</hi> yet if he bad a good conſcience, he would be higher then Princes, and ſcorn to yeild a foote for the proudeſt: but on the contrarie, if hee were as ſtout as <hi>Alexander,</hi> as merry as <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> as wiſe as <hi>Ahithophel,</hi> as proud as <hi>Hammon,</hi> and as rich as <hi>Nabal:</hi> yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing an euill conſcience, he would tremble with <hi>Alexander</hi> for the touch of an ague; quiuer with <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> for the <hi>appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a finger;</hi> hang himſelfe with Ahitophel for that his <hi>counſell was brought to nought;</hi> mourne with Hammon vpon his bed, for the <hi>loſſe of his honour;</hi> or his <hi>heart would die within him
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:21235:94"/>as it did within Nabal for the loſſe of a field;</hi> or in a word, hee would tremble at a very leafe: and therefore fearfull ſhall bee the eſtate of theſe men, when the Lord ſhall thus vnlocke their conſciences, as he hath promiſed he will doe in this place.</p>
                  <p>Now this vnlocking is threefold:
<note place="margin">Keyes to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock conſcience 1. Amazement.</note> Firſt by a generall <hi>amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> when a man is ſuddenly ſtricken, but he knowes no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular cauſe, as Belſhazzar was in the 5. of Dan. <hi>the writing on the wall</hi> vnclaſped his conſcience by a ſudden amazement. Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. Particular knowledge.</note> by a <hi>particular knowledge of the ſinne</hi> that they haue commited, as it was with <hi>Indas;</hi> who ſaid, Phaue ſinned in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying inocent blood: this did ſtrike ſo deepely into his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that be <hi>departed and hanged himſelfe;</hi> and for verie greife, the <hi>rimme of his bellie rent in peices.</hi> Thirdly and laſtly,
<note place="margin">3. Gods depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> by a moſt <hi>lamentable farwel in hell:</hi> when the Lord ſhall ſay, (O my creature,) I made thee <hi>glorious,</hi> but thou haſt <hi>ſpoyled</hi> all thy glorie, and loſt my fauour: farewell my creature, I <hi>the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of liuing water,</hi> I the <hi>liuing God,</hi> I thy <hi>life and length of dayes,</hi> thy <hi>verie breath</hi> muſt leaue thee; and come vnto thee as a <hi>conſuming fire,</hi> as a <hi>roaring lyon,</hi> heape vpon thee all torments in bodie and ſoule: Again, thou ſhalt ſay, Farewell <hi>creator,</hi> far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well <hi>louing wife,</hi> farewell <hi>my children,</hi> and all <hi>my freinds;</hi> fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well <hi>my pleaſures, proſits,</hi> and all my <hi>worldly luſts:</hi> Alas, will none of you pitie mee? wilt thou, O Lord, looke on, and take no compaſſion? and will you my freinds, if with me, curſe me, and cry, A vengence on me? will you thus reward my loue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth? If in heauen, will you crie with <hi>father Abraham, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that you had your pleaſure, when many a Saint ſtarued at your doore,</hi> and therefore iuſtly art thou tormented, and we moſt mercifully rewarded? you did vs much hurt in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended loue; and bleſſed be God you preuailed not in your will. Alas, is it ſo: why then, <hi>O worme of conſcience,</hi> doe thy worſt: <hi>burne fire that can not be quenched;</hi> I <hi>gnaſh with my teeth</hi> to ſee the proſperity of my freinds; &amp; <hi>blaſpheme God</hi> with the reſt of my freinds here in hel: not as ſinning, for that we did in brauery vpon earth; to teare God in peices was our credit: but now we together ſee all to be our puniſhments; and we can take no ſweet ſolace in our companie, as we did vpon
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:21235:95"/>earth. Thus the wicked goe downe to hell to ſee their ſinnes ſet in order before their conſciences, to their euerlaſting ſhame and confuſion, that could not ſee it vpon earth: the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill hath lead them into the mids of hel, as the Prophet the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramits that came to take him, into the mids of <hi>Samaria,</hi> whoſe eyes were opened; to let them then ſee how they were in the midds of their enimies, that meant to doe a miſchiefe vnto Gods meſſenger: ſo the deuill hath lead theſe men blindfoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the midds of hell, and there the Lord hath opened their eyes, to let them ſee what they haue done againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and all his Saints.</p>

<note place="margin">The logicall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalyſis.</note> and as I goe along with them, I ſhall raiſe my doctrines, and my vſes, which after reſolution is our imitation of Gods worke: And therefore I firſt enter the conſideration of the diſpoſition of the words: ſecondly, of the ſimple inuention:
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:21235:95"/>the firſt, ſhewes how reaſons are ioyned together: the ſecond what they are aſunder. For the firſt; the bond that tyes them is twofold; generall, or ſpeciall: the generall bond is in this word <hi>(but,)</hi> all that goes before it, is called the <hi>antecedent,</hi> all that followes, the <hi>conſequent.</hi> The nature of the bond is, to ſet apart ſuch things as doe not diſagree in themſelues, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſome third thing, vnto which they cannot both bee giuen; and this alone makes them diſagree. So in this place, the antecedent, which containes the mercie of God; and the conſequent, which containes Gods iuſtice, do agree in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: for <hi>mercie and iuſtice kiſſe each other:</hi> and therefore the hypocrite hath ſet them at variance, that God muſt no longer bee mercifull, but iuſt in puniſhing him.

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſer.</hi> 1. Firſt, that <hi>that God is equally iuſt and mercifull;</hi> hee that will haue his mercy, muſt be ſure that he falſifie not his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; for a breach of the one, makes a breach of them both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 1. Becauſe they are <hi>equall in God,</hi> for they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his verie beeing. Hence ariſeth an impoſſibilitie in God, to forgiue an offence againſt his iuſtice by his mercy, vntill a ſatisfaction of his iuſtice be made: for the Lord cannot denie himſelfe: indeed men may paſſe by offences committed againſt them, without ſatisfaction, becauſe their iuſtice is not their being, but a qualitie in it, and therefore the iniurie is leſſe: but in nature we ſee, that whatſoeuer makes againſt the beeing of it, cannot be indured, or any peace made with it: and therfore ſinne beeing againſt the very beeing of God, God can make no peace with man, vntill reconciliation bee made by Chriſt, that hath giuen a ful ſatisfaction to Gods iuſtice for the ſinnes of his children.</p>

Indeede we graunt, that in regard of man, there is an inequalitie: for God may be ſaid to be more mercifull vnto them that are ſaued, then iuſt to them that are condemned: for of condemnation, the iuſt cauſe is in man; but of ſaluation, it is wholly from grace: yet in himſelfe they are both equall, and alſo by them he is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glorified; ſeeing that nothing in God can receiue <hi>augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or diminution.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe.</hi> 1. For confutation of errour. 1. If God be equal in iuſtice and mercie, then no mercy to bee expected, but that which will ſtand with the iuſtice of God: therefore mercie in Chriſt muſt ſtand with the iuſtice of God: and Chriſt muſt bring in mercy by perfect fulfilling of the law. Chriſt is the cauſe of life and ſaluation; In <hi>Adam, dying to die,</hi> was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vpon the tranſgreſſion <hi>(els peraduenture we ſhall die, had been true)</hi> therefore die we muſt, either in Chriſt, or in our ſelues; if in Chriſt, then by his death we are freed from that ſentence of the lawe, <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt die the death:</hi> being dead in Chriſt, we are iuſtified from the ſentence of condemnation. But yet there is an other more effentiall part of the lawe;
<note place="margin">Paſſiue obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence might free from death; but actine brings life.</note> and that is, <hi>doe this, and thou ſhalt liue:</hi> and God may as well free vs from <hi>death</hi> without <hi>dying,</hi> as bring vs to <hi>life</hi> without <hi>doing.</hi> We grant then, that the <hi>paſſiue obedience</hi> of Chriſt, hath taken away death; and this is legally done on Chriſts part, but moſt mercifully in regard of vs: if then no more but this righteouſneſſe were imputed, it would prooue of workes in regard of Chriſt, though of grace in regard of vs. So then, this mercie of our deliuerance from death, is equall with Gods iuſtice: Here is dying, in ſtead of dying; and ſo that part of the law, that is, <hi>ſinne, and die,</hi> is repaired, and fully anſwered: but as yet all <hi>righteouſneſſe is not fulfilled:</hi> for I am ſure, that this is a righteouſneſſe of the lawe, as well as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>doe this, and thou ſhalt liue:</hi> and if this bee not done, then Chriſt hath not fulfilled the ſpeciall part of the righteouſnes
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:21235:96"/>of the law for vs: <hi>To doe, and liue,</hi> was our debt vnto God; and therefore Chriſt our ſuretie muſt fulfill it for vs. And this wil prooue a wonderfull mercy to miſerable man, that hath Chriſt to pay his debts, and beſtowe the whole purchaſe of life and ſaluation vpon him: It is a falſe dreame, to think that <hi>non pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator,</hi> and <hi>iuſtus,</hi> a iuſt man, and no ſinner, are equipollent tearmes: For, <hi>non peccator,</hi> is a contradiction to <hi>peccator;</hi> but <hi>iuſtus</hi> is an oppoſite habite, and in act an aduerſe to a ſinner: and ſo the arguments differ. Adam by creation was a iuſt man in <hi>habite,</hi> but not in <hi>act,</hi> and according to that which the Lord required; and ſo death beeing taken away, we are in the way to iuſtification, but not actually iuſt, vntill actually the law be performed, in our ſelues, or another: And becauſe the point is in controuerſie, thereaſons to eſtabliſh this truth may be theſe.</p>

Firſt, the <hi>wiues debt</hi> is made the husbands: and we beeing married vnto Chriſt, the debt that we owe God by our creation, muſt be payed before he will admit of vs: now that debt was, <hi>Do, and liue:</hi> and this Chriſt hath done, and ſo we ſhall liue. Secondly, <hi>Chriſt is the head of his Church:</hi> and therefore muſt he giue vnto his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, <hi>life, motion,</hi> and <hi>all things needfull.</hi> Thirdly, the <hi>ſuretie</hi> muſt pay and diſcharge the whole debt of him for whome he is bound; all of vs are bankerupts, and ſtand in neede to haue a great debt diſcharged for vs, and likewiſe a new ſtocke pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed. To conclude, it is fooliſh to make ſuch a diſtinction as this, ſeeing all the actions of our Mediator, are as wel actiue as
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:21235:98"/>paſſiue: his <hi>life is not taken from him, but he laies it downe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly:</hi> and euen from his <hi>conception,</hi> his <hi>humanitie</hi> being aſſiſted by his <hi>deity,</hi> which could not ſuffer, turned all Chriſts ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings into actions. I haue bin drawne to inlarge my ſelfe in this point, for we can not giue too much to Chriſt: and ſurely we haue giuen no more then the iuſtice of God required. And here by the way, I would haue a common ſpeech amended, <hi>That one droppe of blood was ſufficient for the whole world:</hi> Alas, then why did God in iuſtice draw from Chriſt more then neede? My doctrine is moſt firme and ſure, that God is equall in iuſtice and mercie: ſee but the proportion, <hi>man finite, ſinned finitely;</hi> but <hi>finite ſinnes,</hi> beeing againſt <hi>infinite God,</hi> did violate <hi>infinite iuſtice,</hi> and ſo an <hi>infinite violation: Chriſt</hi> as man, ſuffered <hi>finitely:</hi> but <hi>finite paſſions</hi> were from a Mediator that is infinite, and ſo were of an infinite merit: <hi>finite ſinnes, finite paſſions: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite iuſtice, infinite merits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Vſe</hi> is, to reprehend the fond dreames of the world, that when the Miniſter inquires how they meane to be ſaued, they will anſwer, by their good meanings. Why? but is not God offended by your ſinnes? Yes: but he will haue mercie: for he is a good God, and meanes to damne none. Alas, theſe damne themſelues, while they thus damne Gods iuſtice: for to tell them of Chriſt, to make iuſtice and mercie meete, is but to tell them an idle tale: and therefore they will haue all by their good meanings, and Gods mercies: but except their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings will anſwer Gods iuſtice, they are ſure to goe to hell for all this vaine perſwaſion of mercie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Vſe, correction of a ſecret fault in Gods Iſrael,</hi> that preſume too much of Gods mercie, and are ouer much indulgent to themſelues.

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:21235:98"/>his eyes cannot be bleered with our ſmall gifts, nothing can doe it, but the pretious blood of Chriſt Ieſus, which is God and man, that ſo both God and man might be brought toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: therefore be ſure that as the Lord will doe no iniquitie, ſo he wil haue vs to doe no iniquitie. If we commit our ſinnes in the night, or vnder any pretence, or falſe couerings, be ſure the Lord will bring his iudgement to light euery morning, and therefore let vs be aſhamed of ſinning.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Generall vſe,</hi> is inſtruction, branched into two ſpecialls. Firſt, an <hi>admonition</hi> to the wicked, that they looke vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: for Gods much ſilence, and their many ſinnes, will fill vp a great meaſure of wrath, which the Lord in his iuſtice muſt needes powre vpon them. The ſecond ſpeciall vſe, is a <hi>direction</hi> of a Chriſtian, to carrie himſelfe before God as a <hi>ſonne</hi> and a <hi>ſeruant,</hi> becauſe God is equally a <hi>father</hi> and a <hi>maſter:</hi> a father of compaſſion, but a maſter that will haue his owne. Therefore let God haue the feare and the honour, both of his iuſtice and mercie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Generall vſe</hi> is conſolation, which hath two branches: Firſt, in aduerſitie: Is God equall in iuſtice and mercie? then <hi>fret not at the proſperitie of the wicked,</hi> or be caſt downe for the aduerſitie that they bring vpon thee: for God is iuſt, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will hee reuenge thy cauſe, and bring all the wicked to nought.

                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe the prince of this world,
<note place="margin">The wiſdome of the world.</note> is become as an angel of light, that ſo he might carrie men the better to hell. Vntill the comming of Chriſt, he caried himſelfe in expreſſe
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:21235:105"/>tearmes of worſhip; but when Chriſt was come, he could no more be worſhipped in that manner: and therefore ſince that time, he hath gotten a new forme, euen good confeſſions and gracious praiers, (as the world tearmes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.) Act. 19.13. when the ſonnes of <hi>Sceua</hi> could coniure no more in their old forme, they begin a new, and took in hand to name ouer them which had euill ſpirits, the Name of the Lord Ieſus, ſaying, <hi>We ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure you by Ieſus, whome Paul preacheth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Here I muſt craue pardon a little,
<note place="margin">Againſt deluded witches which ſwarme in the world vnder the name of bleſſers of men and beaſts, but more vſually of beaſts then men or themſelues.</note> to detect a ſtrange deale of miſchiefe in the world. There are a ſort of healing witches, which are called Bleſſers of cattell, and the world thinkes too well of them, and they thinke well of themſelues. Once diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing vpon this poynt, one (I truſt that feareth God) came to me, and told me he had vſed a forme for healing of the eies, wherein he conceiued no euill, but now by the grace of God before he vſed it againe he would die: therefore in hope that ſome other ignorant perſons, may be pulled out of the fire, I will amplifie this reaſon in regard of thoſe deluſions. And that they may ſee their good prayers, I bring in the ſinnes of ſome of their formes of praiers. I will not vtter the formes any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then the ſinnes contained in them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">2. Superſtition.</note> for the bleſſing of cattell: let them take notice of theſe ſinnes. 1. They go thriſe about the beaſt foreſpoken, and ſay ouer a ſet forme of words three times; this can be no leſſe then <hi>ſuperſtition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. Blaſphemie of Chriſts birth,</note> they <hi>blaſpheme</hi> againſt Chriſt moſt horribly, and the blaſphemie is threefold: firſt, againſt his <hi>birth,</hi> as though he had beene borne for cattell: for ſo are their words, Thou that was born in the <hi>bourght of Bethelem</hi> heale this beaſt:
<note place="margin">Baptiſme,</note> ſecondly, againſt his Baptiſme; and was baptized in the <hi>fleame of Iorden</hi> (or rather <hi>flumen:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Office.</note>) thirdly, againſt his office, Thou that ſhed thy <hi>blood;</hi> as though either Chriſt was baptized, or ſhed his pretious blood for the waſhing and purging of bruit beaſts.</p>
                  <p>Third ſinne,
<note place="margin">3. Abuſe of Gods power.</note> is abuſe of <hi>Gods authoritie:</hi> for <hi>ſtand ill, ſtinch ill, ſtanch ill,</hi> can not be done but with great abuſe of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding authoritie: he that bad the <hi>Theames ſtand,</hi> if he had not gotten away, he ſhould haue knowne what they
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:21235:105"/>would haue thought of his power: ſo ſhall the Lord deale with them when his wrath ſhall ouertake them, and they ſhall not be able to flie away.</p>
                  <p>Fourth ſinne, is <hi>blaſphemie againſt the Trinitie:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">4 Sinne againſt the whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</note> for they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude theſe damnable words in the name of the <hi>father, ſonne,</hi> and <hi>holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifth ſinne, is <hi>profanation of Gods holy ordinances;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">5. Profanation.</note> for then comes in a <hi>creed,</hi> a <hi>pater noſter,</hi> and an <hi>Aue-maria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſixt ſinne,

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</note> or rather an admirable puniſhment falling moſt ſecretly vpon them: and that is this, if the beaſt be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoken, then the bleſſer ſhall fall a <hi>goning</hi> or <hi>yoning,</hi> (that is, be ſicke at the heart:) and if this followe, then an euident ſigne the beaſt is foreſpoken. Oh conſider this, yee ſimple and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant people, that will needs forget God: Are not all ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes the plagues of God? then a plaine caſe that God pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth you by the deuil, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you are about your good praiers.
<note place="margin">Superſtition. Abuſe of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>A ſecond kind for beaſts is no better then this; For firſt, if the beaſt haue no name, then muſt they giue it one; or if they haue one, then muſt they tell the name: If this be done, that the beaſt may the better be bleſſed, it is ſuperſtition: or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if for dedication to their office, then abuſe of <hi>baptiſme,</hi> wherein we are named that wee may giue vp our names vnto Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Second ſinne, is the abuſe of Gods prouidence,
<note place="margin">Prouidence.</note> for after this they ſay; if thou be <hi>forſpoken,</hi> by <hi>heart,</hi> by <hi>eye,</hi> or by <hi>tongue,</hi> as though theſe were any cauſes. <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaw more in <hi>Shemeis</hi> curſing and rayling: and therefore God will ſay vnto them, yee haue abuſed me, for I did that euill vnto your goods, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye ſinned againſt me, and haue not repented; therefore haue you done ſinfully, with <hi>Saul,</hi> to goe vnto a witch.</p>
                  <p>The third abuſe is, of a grace in reconciliation: for they ſay,
<note place="margin">Reconciliation.</note> 
                     <hi>Three bitter briſts haſt thou borne, and three good meanings be thy boote;</hi> that is, thou haſt been troubled exceedingly, but thou ſhalt haue great comfort. A ſtrange thing, that that which can be applied to no creature, but the ſonnes of adoption, Rom. 8.28. ſhould be applyed to bruite beaſts.</p>
                  <p>Fourth ſinne, is <hi>blaſphemie:</hi> 1. Againſt the Trinitie, in that
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:21235:106"/>they conclude as before,
<note place="margin">4 Againſt the Trinity, Chriſt, grace.</note> in the name of the <hi>Father, Sonne,</hi> and <hi>holy Ghoſt.</hi> 2. Againſt Chriſt, in that they bring in his fiue <hi>bloody wounds.</hi> 3. Againſt grace; for they ſay to the beaſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe words, would giue thee grace to amend: ſtrange, that grace ſhould bee giuen to beaſts, euen that which followeth the paſſion of our Sauiour Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Fift ſinne,
<note place="margin">5. Profanation.</note> is againſt Gods worſhip, for then come in again a companie of prayers: and it muſt be done three times before and after ſunne riſe or ſet. A worke of darkenes, and full of ſuperſtition.</p>
                  <p>Another kind they haue for the healing of men, both of their eies, and alſo of their teeth, which are of the ſame nature. That for the eyes, is full of <hi>ridiculous ieſting,</hi> and can hardly be named without bluſhing; yet becauſe men are ſo blind that they will perceiue nothing, vntill we iuſt gall them vpon the ſore, I will as modeſtly as I can, ſhew how they ſinne againſt God. Firſt, they vſe lying, in that there is neither ſuch <hi>meeting, asking,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Lying.</note> &amp; <hi>anſwering,</hi> as they ſpeake of: for the 3. virgins (as they tearm them) neuer met thoſe 3. that they ſpeak of: to wit, <hi>Frith, Frith-well,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Forſaking God.</note> and our <hi>Ladie,</hi> as they ſay. Secondly, a great ſinne to aſcribe ſuch power vnto them as ſhall make them mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, for the curing of the eyes, that is, to forſake God and truſt in they knowe not what.
<note place="margin">3. Abuſe of the Saints.</note> Thirdly, to ioyne the bleſſed virgin Marie with two deuils, (for what theſe two names ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie els, I knowe not) muſt needs be a great abuſe of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saints.
<note place="margin">4. Ieſting.</note> Fourthly, there is ridiculous ieſting in ſerious matters: for the forme is ſo fooliſh, that it would make any man breake out into laughter. Now the curing of the eyes is no ſmall matter; the eie is deare and pretious, and therefore ought to be dealt withall in a more ſerious manner.
<note place="margin">5. Abuſe of the creatures.</note> Fiftly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of Gods creatures, as redde gold, running water, greene graſſe, gray-gooſe feather: which neither by diuine ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Sacraments; nor phyſically haue any ſuch power of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
<note place="margin">6. Superſtition.</note> and therefore they ſhall riſe againſt them at the day of iudgement. Sixtly, theſe beeing dipped in the water, and the eie thriſe waſhed, is the cure: meere ſuperſtition, and a meere ceremonie of the deuills, which hath his power and efficacie
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:21235:106"/>from the deuill.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, for the tooth: for faine would I make an ende, yet ſtill doe I reſpect the good of mens ſoules. This is but ſhort in forme, yet full enough of ſinne: firſt,
<note place="margin">1. Coniuring. 2. Abuſe of the creatures. 3. Of Gods ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.</note> it containes in it the forme of coniuring: ſecondly, abuſe of Gods creatures: third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, abuſe of Gods ſacrifices, for the creatures that they haue abuſed, as a <hi>haſel ſticke</hi> written on muſt be burnt in the fire: I knowe not for what ende, except to ſacrifice for the teeth: fourthly, the words written are both ſenſleſſe and ridiculous:

                     <hi>there is a ſalue for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie ſore,</hi> we ſee the cure wrought by them, and all that they doe is by good prayers, and we ſee no hurt in them. Well, a falue for euerie ſore muſt be gotten lawfully, and alſo applyed lawfully; but here is neither of both. Secondly, they doe the cure; that is a lie, for it is the deuill that doth it, to get men to beleeue him, and ſo for their paines they looſe their ſoules. Examples of this wee haue in the Scripture:
<note place="margin">Witches doe many thing, but the whole efficacy is from the deuill.</note> Saul had the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters came to paſſe that the deuill told him, and therefore ſaies God, Deut. 13.2. though it come to paſſe, yet thou ſhalt not liſten thereunto: for the Lord doth it to trie thee withal, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou wilt ſerue him, or other gods. Act. 8. Samaria was ſeduced by Simon the Sorcerer; they eſteemed him as ſome great man, gaue heed vnto him from the leaſt to the greateſt, becauſe he had bewitched them with ſorceries: One was that he would die as Chriſt did, and riſe the third day: therefore deluding the people with a ramme which they beheaded in ſtead of Simon, and hauing caried it forth and buried it, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon himſelfe appeares againe the third day: yet ſee I pray you this Simon will bee baptized as well as the reſt, and make a ſhew of beleeuing, continue with Philip, wondring at the ſignes and miracles which were done: yet when they were
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:21235:107"/>to be confirmed by Peter and Iohn, and by laying on of hands the holy Ghoſt to be receiued, he would beſtow money that he might haue that for the perfection of his art; but now for all his baptiſme and beleeuing, he is found out of Peter to <hi>bee in the gall of bitterneſſe, and the bond of iniquitie:</hi> and all that hee prayeth for, is onely that the iudgements might not light on him: And I would to God that theſe perſons would but bee ſo much touched, that they would feare Gods iudgements for theſe ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Hiſtorie is plaine for it: A woman in <hi>Italie</hi> hauing ſore eies, and could by no meanes be eaſed of the paine, was perſwaded that a Prieſt could doe it for her: therefore comming vnto him, &amp; intreating with a great reward in her hands, the Prieſt againſt his skill writ her a paper to be hanged about her neck, wiſhing her no good, but all miſchiefe, yet ſhe taking the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and following his rule, was preſently cured of her eyes; yet when a yeare was expired, ſhe would needs haue the paper read, wherein were written theſe words, <hi>Diabolus eruat ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los tuos, &amp; foramina ſtercoribus impleat:</hi> which when ſhee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, burnes the paper for anger, and preſently her eyes were in as ill caſe as euer before. <hi>Hemingius</hi> reading the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke lecture in the ſchooles, and beeing diſpoſed to make merrie with his auditors, in ieſting manner told them, that if any man ſhould ſay theſe two verſes ouer one ſicke of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, it would preſently leaue them. The verſes were vſed of antient Logitians for the figures of a Syllogiſme:
<q xml:lang="lat">
                        <l>Fecana, Cage, Daphenes, Gebare, Gedaco,</l>

                     </q> One in the companie more ſimple then the reſt, tried his words, and the euent followed for the ſpace of a yeere before it was knowne, inſomuch that he was famous for his art: But as ſoone as <hi>Hemingius</hi> knew the matter, and had preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, all his practiſe came vnto an ende: ſhewing that the deuill will worke no longer then men ſerue him ignorantly: and therefore if the effect follow, no wonder: for the parties that doe theſe things, and the perſons that ſeeke vnto them are ignorant and blinded people, ſuch as haue no true feare of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:21235:107"/>God; for euery one that ſeareth God, ſpeaketh againſt them; nay, they ſpeake againſt themſelues: for tell mee. I pray you, how many of theſe vſe to bleſſe <hi>themſelues, children,</hi> and <hi>family</hi> by earneſt praier vnto God? tell me how many of them haue Bibles in their houſes, and godly exerciſes: ſurely they may profeſſe what they will for beaſts, but they proclaime them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be worſe then bruit beaſts. Is there neuer a man of God able to pray as well as they hath God giuen them a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meaſure of his ſpirit, then he hath done to any other? If this be ſo commendable, why ſend they not to the miniſter before theſe wretches, to intreat him to pray for their cattell? but, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, no maruell, if the world be deluded, when they will not intertaine the truth of God in the loue of the truth. For it were ſtrange to conſider, how perſons beeing galled, did euen gnaſh againſt theſe declarations, that they ſhould be taught by any young headed boy. Well, let them know, that they haue euery mothers ſonne of them, made anvnknowne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion againſt themſelues: for except they repent, I tell them as much in writing, as I haue done in ſpeaking, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaued.</p>

<note place="margin">From the ill di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of the ſoule.</note> That which lies raw in the ſtomack, and ſo conſequently ſpoyled in the firſt concoction, can neuer be mended againe in the liuer, or in the aſſimulation of the parts, where euery thing drawes, and ſucks for his own vſe: So all the mercies and iudgments of God, lie raw at the heart of a wicked man, and there are ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſo that no good blood can be diſperſed through bodie &amp; ſoule, to make the ſanguine complexion of a Chriſtian; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall you ſee any member to gather ſtrength, but rather to pine away: euen as men doe that labour of conſumptions,
<note place="margin">Good things without Gods bleſſing, heauie curſes.</note> when they are fedde with the beſt nouriſhments; when wee may ſee a <hi>poore beggers boy,</hi> that fares hardly, euen with ſuch diet as would make a man melancholick to looke on it; yet he is freſh and well liking: ſo Chriſtians, which are of the blood royall, are like <hi>Daniel,</hi> which was better liking feeding on the

Secondly, correction of the godly, that are diſcontented with affliction; would they haue the eſtate of a wicked man, for the inioying of all his wealth? I hope no good ſoule would wiſh it: neither would I wiſh it my very enemie: and therefore yee godly, ſet your foules arreſt with the worſt of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſions: for it is not onely too good for vs, but it ſhall prooue better in the feeding vpon, then euer we expected; &amp; therfore Dauid often ſaid, <hi>It was good for him that he was afflicted:</hi> ſmall comfort for a man to drinke of a cup of wine, that hath but one droppe of poyſon in it: to be at a feaſt, and yet caſting his eye vpward, ſees a ſword hanging in a weake thread, with the poynt toward his head.

Secondly, a direction to the godly, to refraine from wicked mens compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie; becauſe a man can hardly participate with them in good things, but he ſhall be defiled. Wee dare not eate with ſome perſons very wholeſome meate, or drinke of the cuppe after them, becauſe they haue in their bodies ſome poyſonfull diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe: If we haue this natural wiſedome, for to ſaue the bodie, let vs, I beſeech you, haue as great wiſdome for the ſoule, leaſt it be hurt in wicked mens companie euen by good things: that poyſon in nature is moſt dangerous, that is offered in a ſweet flower; becauſe the one delights the ſenſes, and ſo is willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imbraced, but the poyſon enters in with it, and ſo cauſeth death.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 1. <hi>No man will denic himſelfe,</hi> and therefore though oftentimes he denie the rule of reaſon, yet neuer will be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely denie reaſon; becauſe reaſon is one of the principall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in man; and therefore muſt it trudge to make vp his broken concluſions. Reaſon cannot act without reaſon, and therefore men will haue falſe reaſon, before they will haue none.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Is the <hi>ſimplicitie of truth,</hi> and <hi>multiplicitie of errour:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">From errors multiplicity.</note> and therefore though men cannot bring in truth to maintaine falſhood, yet may they haue many falſhoods, to make a faire ſhewe for one falſhood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Is the nature of <hi>oppoſition:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">From oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which on both ſides is to defend his own.</note> Truth and falſhood are deadly enemies, and therefore as truth laboureth to confirme himſelfe by all thoſe that loue him; ſo falſhoold laboureth to gather together all his forces by thoſe that maintaine him. Hence it comes to paſſe, that heretickes will neuer be coufu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but as long as they can breath, they will vent what they haue conceiued.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. <hi>reprehenſion.</hi> Firſt, confutation of the wicked, in that they adde ſinne vnto ſinne: Firſt, to poyſon themſelues with ſtrange opinions: and ſecondly to enquire for reaſons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may ground themſelues in theſe poyſoned errors: ſo that from errors they grow to hereſie; from <hi>ſimple ignorance,</hi> to that which we call <hi>affected ignorance:</hi> ignorance is ſo good a mother to deuotion, that ſhe will nource vp error, and error will grow vp to hereſie, a child of rebellion. Secondly, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the godly, that they yeeld not at any time to the leaſt motions of errour, leaſt they become diſputers for errors and oppoſers of Gods truth. Many honeſt and well-minded perſons, haue gotten ſuch familiar acquaintance with here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:21235:114"/>that they haue beene poyſoned by them, and ſo haue come to hate the truth, which once they imbraced.</p>

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. <hi>inſtruction.</hi> Firſt, an admonition of the wicked, that they be a little more ſober in broaching of their errors, leaſt that the Lord ſeeing their malice againſt his truth, come with a ſharpe reproofe, and cut them off ſuddenly. Secondly, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the godly, to keepe themſelues to Gods word, and neuer labour to wreſt it, either <hi>to the right hand, or to the left,</hi> for the vpholding of any conceits that the deuill, their owne fleſh, or the wicked world ſhall ſuggeſt vnto them.</p>

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. <hi>conſolation.</hi> Firſt, in proſperitie to remember that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie good thing we enioy, ſhall willingly bee ſpent for the maintaining of the truth, and the oppoſing of error, euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the death. Secondly, in aduerſitie, to conſider how wee haue vſed no indirect meanes to bring our purpoſes to paſſe, but ſtill haue reſted vpon the Lord, for the reuelation of his will, and the time of our deliuerance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſer.</hi> 7. The ground of all wicked mens opinions, and likewiſe of hypocrits in this place,
<note place="margin">Abſurditie of Atheiſme.</note> is nothing but a thought, and a conceit of their owne: for ſo the words runne plainely, <hi>(therefore thou thoughteſt:)</hi> and this will bee plaine, if we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it in all the former opinions. Firſt, <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> there is no God;
<note place="margin">Of God.</note> becauſe they thinke he ſeeth them not: euen as if the owle or woodcock, when they haue gotten their heads into a hole, ſhould thinke no body ſeeth them, becauſe they ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodie: or like the blind man in Athens, which going to bed with his eye-ſight, and admiring at the extraordinarie length of the night, crieth out againſt the gods, that they kept the day ſo long from appearing; when alas, in the night time hee fell blind, and therefore thought that all the world was blind as well as he; when indeed other men had beene vp, and at their workes, now readie to ſleep againe: So deale theſe men with God: they blind themſelues, and therefore God muſt be blind too; but he will find them out, and then they ſhal know that this was but a conceit.</p>
                  <p>Againe, <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>fortune</hi> are the two ſupreame cauſes. I would that theſe men had ſtood by the ouens mouth in Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:21235:114"/>cap. 3. and had ſeene <hi>the three children in the middeſt of the fire, bound in their coates, their hoſen and their cloakes, with their other garments, and yet not an haire of their heads to be burnt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their coats changed, nor any ſmell of fire to be vpon them,</hi> and yet the flame of the fire iſſuing out of the ouen to haue ſlaine thoſe men that brought them forth: what reaſon would they haue giuen of this? I feare not but with the king, they would haue made a decree, that they would neuer againe blaſpheme againſt this God, becauſe <hi>there was neuer God that could deliuer after this ſort:</hi> we will therefore declare his ſignes and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and <hi>confeſſe that his kingdome is an euerlaſting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The conceit of the <hi>Epicures:</hi> No world,
<note place="margin">Creation.</note> becauſe no inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor matter; is a fond conceit: for the beſt workeman in the beſt worke, is able to worke without any of theſe; and to worke by any of theſe, is imperfection: for who goeth to the market to buy inſtruments to make him reaſon with all? &amp; yet to reaſon is a more excellent worke then to build a ſtately pallace; therefore God beeing moſt perfect, could not worke by inſtruments; for then ſhould be haue been imperfect.</p>
                  <p>Againe, <hi>for his prouidence;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prouidence.</note> if a man ſee a father whippe his <hi>child,</hi> and ſpare his <hi>ſeruant,</hi> and ſhould ſay he loued his ſeruant better then his child, euery man would laugh him to ſcorne: ſo if the Lord whip his children, ſpare the wicked, it is not for want of loue to the one, or manifeſtation of loue to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So for the laſt iudgement, Peter telleth them, 2. Pet. 3.5.
<note place="margin">Laſt iudgment.</note> 
                     <hi>That this they willingly knewe not, how all things were by the word of God, and by the ſame word are ſtill kept in ſtore againſt the day of iudgement, and of the deſtruction of vngodly men: for one day is with the Lord as a thouſand yeres, and a thouſand yeeres as one day:</hi> no ſlacknes with him, onely the creature muſt haue his time, and then ſhall be periſh, or be ſaued.</p>
                  <p>The conceits of partiall Atheiſts:
<note place="margin">Partial atheiſme</note> It is too baſe for the Lord to take care for baſe creatures; they might as well ſay, to haue created them: for the Lord made nothing which his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence did not guide; and if he be the firſt and laſt of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, then as all creatures are from him, ſo all muſt be vnto
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:21235:115"/>him; and that by his owne wiſdome. It is the <hi>cunning Muſitian</hi> that muſt haue the handling of an inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t compoſed of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtrings, and in nature diſſonant, to make it ſound foorth his skilfull praiſe: and therefore to keepe that excellent har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony among the creatures, muſt needs be the hand of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: He can make <hi>lice, ſwarmes of flyes,</hi> and an hoſt of <hi>graſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi> fight moſt ſtoutly againſt Pharaoh: now no generall was able to order the battell, but the Lord of hoſts, and this is no baſe thing: for hereby would the Lord get him a name for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.
<note place="margin">Of ſinne.</note> Againe, for the decree of ſin: cannot the Lord bring good out of euill, <hi>light out of darkenes,</hi> health out of ſickenes, glory out of ſhame? and therefore may he decree ſinne, and yet be no author of ſinne: for hee hath goodneſſe enough out of ſinne, which ſhall ſerue his turne, and the reſt he will leaue to the firſt inuenters.
<note place="margin">Of Vbiquitie.</note> The conceit of the Aramites ſhall appeare, when they come to fight with Iſrael in the plaines, then ſhall they know that God is as well <hi>the God of the plaines, as of the mountaines.</hi> For Phyſitians, that faine would exerciſe their wits in the wonders of the Lord.
<note place="margin">Of extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prouidence.</note> If reaſon may be giuen for fourteene yeares faſt, ſurely Chriſts faſting fortie dayes ſhalbe worth nothing: I had rather ſay as Chriſt did to the deuil after his faſt, <hi>Man liues not by bread alone, but by euerie word that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth out of the mouth of God.</hi> The Iſraelites apparell, and the ſhooes on their feet, as new at the ende of fortie yeers, as they were the firſt day they entred into the wilderneſſe, was the worke of this word; and no naturall reaſon can bee giuen for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aſtrologians</hi> are well anſwered euen by their owne lyes:

Hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, he could tell; for hee had alreadie calculated that hee ſhould: Then ſaies the Biſhop, I will ſee whether I can op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſtarres, or no: and thus the ſimple <hi>Aſtrologian</hi> was made a lyar.</p>
                  <p>Againe,
<note place="margin">Idolatrie.</note> for idolatrie, a meere conceit: they had plentie, and felt no want, therefore idolatrie was good: the world is all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:21235:115"/>therefore the deuill is very quiet. The ſhippes can not paſſe ouer <hi>Goodwine ſands</hi> as in times paſt, therefore the old-mans iudgement was better then all the reſt, becauſe he neuer knewe it vntill <hi>Tenterton-ſteeple</hi> was built; a reaſon of a doting foole; Tenterton-ſteeple is built, therefore no ſhippes can paſſe ouer Goodwine ſands: <hi>baculus ſtat in angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo, ergo coelum mouetur:</hi> the ſtaffe is in the corner, therefore the heauens are mooued. See it in the children of Iſrael; <hi>Vp Aaron, make vs gods to goe before vs for we knowe not what is become of this Moſes:</hi> euery word a ſtrange abſurditie: firſt, <hi>make a god;</hi> a meere contradiction, that a creature ſhould make his creator: ſecondly gods, that was a <hi>calfe,</hi> which is a blockiſh creature, and more fooliſh then any: now that the fooliſheſt creature ſhould become the wiſeſt of all beeings, is as ſtrange as the other: thirdly, to <hi>go before vs:</hi> all Iſrael were not able to put life into that dead picture, and therefore to goe before them was impoſſible: it would not ſo much as follow them, except they caried it: and therefore beaſts they were, that ſaw how God went before them <hi>in a pillar of fire by night,</hi> and <hi>in a cloud by day,</hi> and when there enemies were behinde them, made this pillar ſtand behinde them, ſhould now put their confidence in a dead picture. The Papiſts ſay man is Gods image, which may be painted, therefore may there be an image of God: Alas, what Papiſt can paint the ſoule of man, or the righteouſneſſe and holineſſe that is in the foule. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> ſaies the ſtarres might be worſhipped, but for feare of Idolatrie: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the ſelfe ſame, as if I ſhould ſay, a man might cut an other mans throate, but for feare of murther: to cut the throate, and murther, are not farre aſunder: for the firſt is the cauſe, and muſt needs bring in the other.</p>
                  <p>For hereſie, meere conceits. This is my body,
<note place="margin">Hereſie.</note> therfore it is ſo in deed. Chriſt is a <hi>rocke,</hi> a <hi>ſtone,</hi> a <hi>vine,</hi> therfore he is ſo in deed: nothing but a rocke, a ſtone, a vine, ſurely ſtones and rockes will reaſon better then thus. Chriſts man-hood is vnited to the deitie, therefore it is euery where; as though things vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted were confounded, and the man-hood were equall with the deitie, nay the very ſelfe ſame: for to haue the ſame eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:21235:116"/>properties, is to haue the ſame eſſence. Chriſt muſt die, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is not Chriſt: becauſe be that dies, endures not for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: as though the graue hauing ſhut in Chriſt three dayes, ſhould haue kept him for euer: well, he roſe againe, and hath openly manifeſted himſelfe to liue for euer. <hi>Diues</hi> calls in bel, <hi>father Abraham, haue mercie vpon me,</hi> therefore to call to the Saints is no ſuch intolerable thing: a good argument, that muſt needs be fetch out of hell to prooue ſo damnable an aſſertion. <hi>Pope Alexander</hi> treading vpon the necke of <hi>Fredericke,</hi> hath his conceit for it; <hi>vpon the baſiliske ſhalt thou goe:</hi> the kiſſing of his feete, becauſe <hi>the ſinner kiſſed the feet of Chriſt;</hi> therefore his church, becauſe bone of his bone; therefore the Pope, becauſe he is the church: as beaſts, Pſal. 8. are ſubiect vnto man, ſo all men vnto the Pope: ſurely as beaſts, for he is the maſter beaſt of them all, Reu. 13. Two ſwords in Chriſts family, therefore two kingdomes on the Popes head. Peter Act. 10. <hi>riſe and kill;</hi> therefore may the Pope excommunicate and kill Princes.

Some haue thought they haue beene dead men, and therefore would not eate, becauſe dead men can not eate; yet one faining himſelfe to be dead, and they putting meat into his mouth falls to eating; and the conceited perſon ſeeing that, he falls of eating too, and ſo his life was preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Others haue beene ſo reſolute in their conceits, that they haue died in them: as <hi>Arthemidorus</hi> a Grammarian, who vpon the ſight of a crocodile, was ſo ſore amaſed, that he forgat all

Euen thus falls it out with wicked men, that either they ſee one conceit by another, to prooue fooliſh, or els they doe ſo ſtrongly ground themſelues in their conceits, that they will neuer be drawne to any better perſwaſions. As many an ignorant Papiſt, his fathers were ſo, and he hopes well of them, and God forbid that they ſhould be in hell, therefore he liues as they did, he hopes well. Yet others after they haue ſeene, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>no profit of thoſe things whereof they are now aſhamed,</hi> become to change their minds, and ſee all was but a conceit of pleaſure.

From hence might be obſerued; firſt, that more may abſolutely be affirmed of ſin &amp; ſilence coupled together, then
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:21235:118"/>can be vpon condition: for God makes no condition with ſinners for the time of his ſilence, neither haue they any leaſe from God how long they ſhall ſinne, and he wil ſay nothing: for God will haue his libertie. Secondly, wicked men ſhall haue nothing to excuſe them from God. Indeed their ſinnes goe before Gods ſilence; Gods ſilence comes after, and they againe come after with more ſinne: for ſo are the words ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together: 1. <hi>They doe:</hi> 2. <hi>God is ſilent:</hi> 3. <hi>They thinke:</hi> it may be by their latter ſinning, they haue a perſwaſion of conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of peace: but alas they are deceiued; for hereby riſeth a threefold iudgement againſt them: one for their firſt ſinne; a ſecond for the abuſe of his ſilence; and a third for that they haue had no meaſure in their ſinning, and therefore ſhall God haue no meaſure in his puniſhing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſer.</hi> But the obſeruation proper to the place is this, that mans ſinnes, and Gods ſilence may ſtand together for a time. The diſciples of our Sauiour Chriſt knewe not of what ſpirits they were, <hi>when they asked Chriſt, that hee would call for fire from heauen to deſtroy his enemies.</hi> Indeed if any tender hearted man ſhould ſit but one howre in the throne of God almighty, and look downe vpon the earth as God doth continually, and ſee what abhominations are done in that houre, he would vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly in the next ſet all the world on fire, and not ſuffer his wrath to bee pacified, or the fire to be quenched.</p>

Hence is God called the moſt <hi>perfect idaea</hi> of all things: a skilfull workeman hath the plot of his building in his head, long before he begin his worke out of himſelfe: Pſal. 139.2. <hi>thou vnderſtandeſt my thought afarre off:</hi> and v. 16. thine eies did ſee me when I was without forme: for in thy booke were all things written, which in continuance were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned,

Thirdly, for the circumſtance of perſons: he knoweth all by their names, Pſal. 147.4. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no companie ſhall excuſe thee. Indeede in the world, <hi>multitudo peccantium, tollit poenam peccati:</hi> when multitudes ſinne, then mens lawes dare not execute: yet be ſure with the Lord, he that runnes with a multitude to doe euill, ſhal be ſure to be puniſhed with them. Neither great men, nor rich men, ſhall be able to reſcue vs out of the hands of God: therefore the point is cleare, that the Lords knowledge is moſt exact
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:21235:120"/>in all particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Vſe</hi> is reprehenſion: firſt, confutation of the wicked, that are aſhamed to doe that in the preſence of men, which they dare moſt impudently doe before God: ſurely hee is able to iudge more exactly of our offences then any man: &amp; therefore if we labour to keepe our ſelues ſecret from the eyes of men, how ſhould we not tremble to ſinne before God? Secondly, correction of the godly, that doe not alwaies ſet themſelues in the preſence of God, but ſometimes take libertie to ſlip in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wayes of their owne hearts, thinking that this is but a ſmall ſinne, and therefore the <hi>Lord will be mercifull to me in this thing:</hi> neuer conſidering the <hi>puritie of the Lord, and the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his glorie,</hi> which is alwayes ſhining round about them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Vſe</hi> inſtruction: firſt, an admonition to the wicked, that beat their fellow feruants, becauſe their maſter deferreth his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming: let them take heed, for he will come at vnawares vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; and let them bluſh for ſhame, ſeeing that mens ſcr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants here vpon earth, hearing that their maſter approacheth, betake themſelues to their worke, although before they were at their ſports &amp; idle recreations: we know that ſchoole-boies in the abſence of their maſter, leaue their ſeats, ſpread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues abroad, yet the verie voyce of <hi>(venit magiſter)</hi> the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter comes, preſently makes euery one haſtily betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto his ſeat. Shall then man bee ſo bold, as to dare to leaue his place, betake himſelfe to his owne pleaſure, when the verie eye of his God lookes vpon him? ſurely nothing is more obuious vnto our eye then this, which argueth that the world is very deſtitute of the feare of God. Secondly, this may be a driection to the godly, to examine them-ſelues in all their particular carriages. Thus Dauid deales with his ſoule, vpon the conſideration of Gods excellent knowledge, Pſal. 139. to the ende: firſt, a pretious eſtimation of it, 17, 18. how deare, how great, what account to make vp the ſumme: all is too ſhort: yet this will he aime at, when he awakes, he will ſtill be with God. Indeede in the violence of paſſion, Dauid may make warre a pretenſe to excuſe Vrias death; but yet Pſal. 51. it ſhall cauſe him vtter many a bitter word, heauie ſighs, and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:21235:121"/>euen water his couch with teares. The ſecond, is the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of his zeale: 1. in his loue of the maieſtie of God, v. 19, 20.2. of his hatred to the wicked, that diſhonour God, v. 21, 22. See them both: <hi>Oh that thou wouldeſt ſlay, O God, the wicked and bloody men, to whome I ſay, depart ye (from me;) which ſpeake wickedly of thee, and beeing thine enemies are lifted vp in vaine: I hate them, I contend with them as with mine vtter enemies.</hi> The 3. his confidence, v. 23. <hi>Trie me, O God, and know my heart, prooue me, and know my thoughts, conſider if there be any way of wickednes in me, and lead me in thy way for euer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This conſideration, can not but haue powerfull operations in the hearts of Chriſtians, fire all that is within them: let vs ſee it in a few of <hi>Dauids</hi> affections in the Pſalmes, breathing zeale out of euery pipe.</p>

               <p>THE ſecond part is the holineſſe of the Lords ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; which is twofold, <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>iuſtice.</hi> Mercy,
<note place="margin">Silence.</note> 
                  <hi>I held my tongue;</hi> Iuſtice, <hi>but I will reprooue thee.</hi> Mercy is deſcribed by ſowre arguments; firſt, by his <hi>quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> ſilence: ſecondly, by his <hi>obiect,</hi> about which hee is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and that is the doings of the wicked: thirdly, by the <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall effects,</hi> and they are wicked thoughts: fourthly, by the forme and manner of theſe thoughts, and that is, to make God like themſelues.</p>
               <p>Firſt, of Gods ſilence: which is nothing elſe, but Gods <hi>cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie</hi> in his <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>long ſuffering,</hi> with his <hi>bountifulneſſe,</hi> and generall goodneſſe toward ſinners. That this may more clearly appeare, we are to vnderſtand that the Lord which is abſolute beeing in himſelfe, Exod. 3.14. can haue nothing gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto him, which is not himſelfe: for <hi>I am, that I am,</hi> is a propoſition that hath no more in the <hi>conſequent,</hi> then was in the <hi>antecedent:</hi> for I am, is the antecedent, and I am, is the conſequent: therefore euery conſequent in God, is God. God is ſilent, God the antecedent is I am, and ſilent the conſequent is I am: for nothing is giuen to God that is leſſe then I am, and greater then I am, is impoſſible. Hence God is one moſt ſimple beeing, and impoſſible to be vnderſtood of our ſhallow capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities: therefore hath it pleaſed his maieſtie, that we might
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:21235:126"/>vnderſtnd ſome thing of him, to ſhew vs his backe parts, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. 33.23. which are his glorious attributes, Exod. 34. v. 6, 7. among which, we haue this ſilence of God; <hi>ſlowe to anger, and aboundant to goodnes and truth.</hi> Now theſe attributes are of diuers ſorts:
<note place="margin">Abſolute attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Conditionall.</note> ſome <hi>abſolute,</hi> ſome <hi>conditionall,</hi> ſome both <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute</hi> and <hi>conditionall:</hi> abſolute, which at all haue no ariſe from the creatures, but follow his abſolute beeing: as his <hi>infinitneſſe, eternitie,</hi> and the like, which doe follow from that he is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſes, not looking at him for his effects in his creatures: others meerly conditionall; as in creation, <hi>omnipotencie;</hi> which is only in God in regard of his creatures, which in time might feele the worke of an euerlaſting worker. For in God, creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was alwaies act, and neuer power: otherwiſe ſhould the Lord haue begun his act, and then it ſhould not haue beene e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall. Indeede his creature felt the beginning of it, for once it was nothing: and to make that ſomething, we tearme it om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie, which is in the creature alone: for God is not om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mpotent in the generation of his ſonne, neither the ſonne and the father omnipotent, in the proceeding of the holy Ghoſt, becauſe this is an abſolute and eternall genreation, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, that was neuer out of act, and therefore vncapable of any power.</p>
               <p>In the fall of man, this ſilence is meerely conditionall: for if there had bin no ſinne, then ſhould God haue had no ſilence. So in the ſtate of redemption, grace is giuen to God only from that worke in the creature, receiuing him to mercy for Chriſts ſake. For attributes, that may be ſaid to ariſe from his beeing, &amp; yet appeare in his works; are in creation, <hi>goodneſſe, wiſedome,</hi> and the like, which are abſolute in God, and before creation, yet manifeſted from creation, ſeeing he hath placed in theſe creatures, the foote-ſteppes of his goodneſſe, and wiſdome. Now his eternitie and infinitneſſe, may be collected from the creation,

A ſecond waie, is <hi>per mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:21235:126"/>eminentia,</hi> by way of excellencie; as what is excellent in the creature, to giue it to God in the higheſt degree: man is good, wiſe, iuſt, holy, therefore God is goodneſſe it ſelfe, wiſedome it ſelfe, iuſtice it ſelfe, holineſſe it ſelfe. The third, <hi>per viam cauſationis,</hi> by waie of making; as the world is a worke aboue the reach of a creature, therefore God made it: redemption a worke aboue the power of angels and men, therefore God muſt redeeme: ſanctification no gift in man, therfore the worke of the holy Ghoſt: and for any creature to thruſt in with God, is no leſſe then blaſphemie. Againe, in mans fall, iuſtice puts forth it ſelfe, yet was it abſolute in God before, and therefore might it appoint, preſcribe laws, and ſet downe certain ends, hauing no conſideration of the creatures ſinne; yet the execution will alwaies follow mans ſinne. So in redemption, mercie which is not the ſame with ſilence in this place, but a free acceptation of the creature in Chriſt: this is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo abſolute in God, and ſo might haue his worke in God, long before man was miſerable: but to execute this mercie vpon the creature, muſt needes be in his miſerie, where it appeares to vs: &amp; ſo both election &amp; reprobation are manifeſt vnto the creature, yet were long before in God, and with God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that diſtinction vpon which ſome Diuines build, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow Gods decree of reprobation and election, before the corrupt maſſe, is not ſound; for thus ſay they: Gods attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, are ſome of them abſolute, as <hi>eternity, infiniteneſſe, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wiſedome,</hi> and theſe are preſuppoſed before the beeing of the creature: others againe conditionall, and alwaies haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect vnto the creature; as iuſtice, and mercie: no iuſtice but vpon the condition of ſinne, and no mercie but vpon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of miſerie: All this is true, beeing vnderſtood of the execution of mercy and iuſtice: but abſolutely it is falſe, being conceiued of the firſt actions of iuſtice and mercie: for the firſt action of any wiſedome, is to diſpoſe of all things for their ends; and then conſequently to execute: one thing to ſpeake what God doth in himſelfe, and another thing what hee doth in his creatures: therefore by the rule of diuinitie in this place, wee vnderſtand by <hi>ſilence</hi> ſuch a kind of mercie, as appeares
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:21235:127"/>vnto man in the ſtate of his ſinne and miſerie, which is equal to all, and no diſtinct fauour of God in Chriſt, but his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall goodneſſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, on mans part; for as ſoone as hee had ſinned againſt God, preſently vpon the very ſinne he was guiltie of <hi>hel; death,</hi> and <hi>damnation,</hi> and the iuſtice of the Lord apprehended him, and therefore preſent execution; and if he had cried, <hi>haue pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience with me, and I will pay thee all;</hi> it had beene in vaine: for he ſhould haue promiſed more then he had been able to pay: therefore the Lord muſt haue patience with him <hi>for his mercie ſake,</hi> and a little releiue him in his miſerie. Hence one reaſon is mans miſerie: a ſecond is in regard of God himſelfe, who will be holy in all his workes, and therefore iuſt and merciful: iuſt becauſe of iniquitie, mercifull becauſe hee will haue all iuſt commendation. Shal it be the commendation of man to ſpare, and ſhall not the Lord ſpare? yes aſſuredly, the Lord is full of clemencie and bountifulneſſe: From his clemencie appeareth his patience and long ſuffering: and from his bountifulneſſe many a temporall bleſſing, as wee ſee by daily experience, to the tempting of the verie godly, that there is no diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Rhetoricke</hi> in the words: here is firſt to <hi>hold the tongue,</hi> put for <hi>ſilence:</hi> then ſecondly, ſilence put for <hi>patience, meekenes, gentleneſſe, long-ſuffering, and bountifulnes:</hi> for the <hi>Grammar,</hi> the word ſignifies, ſuch a kind of ſilence, as goes with <hi>deafnes,</hi> as though God were both dumme and deafe: but the Lord is not ſo, for he hath made both the dumme and deafe, Exod. 4.11. and therefore can hee be dumme and deafe at his pleaſure, and alſo ſpeake and heare at his pleaſure. So then I find this word in a more ſignificant coniugation, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a double action is ſignified: <hi>Tacitum cogitare,</hi> to thinke a ſecret, to be ſilent for better deliberation: and therefore Gods ſilence is no idle ſilence, but full of wiſdome.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, for the <hi>logicke,</hi> this is an adiunct giuen vnto God; now adiuncts make not for the beeing of any thing, but for his welbeing: and therefore the Logicke tels me, that though ſilence bee not for Gods beeing, yet it is a grace that the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:21235:127"/>Lord will put vpon himſelfe, when he ſaies, <hi>I am ſilent:</hi> And therefore hauing found out in ſome meaſure the wiſdome of God in his word, let vs magnifie him in it, and apply it to our owne hearts.</p>

                  <hi>Vſe.</hi> 1. <hi>reprehenſion:</hi> Firſt, confutation of the wicked, which cry, Mal. 3.14. <hi>It is in vaine to ſerue God, and what profit is it that we haue kept his commandement, and that we haue walked humbly before him? we count the proud bleſſed, euen they that worke wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe are ſet vp, and they that tempt God, yea, they are deliuered.</hi> Alas, poore wretches, if there were no more to condemne thee, yet this were ſufficient, that God hath beene ſilent with thee. Secondly correction of the godly, that as yet haue not
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:21235:128"/>learned this leſſon, to imitate God in refraining their tongues from ſpeaking againſt wicked men: if they know their calling, they may doe it: but to exaſperate the wicked, is not alwayes neceſſarie: nay alas, they cannot refraine their tongues from ſpeaking againſt their brethren; when they may ſee plainly by this doctrine, that the Lord is ſilent with his verie enemies. Againe, it reprehends all fretting at the proſperitie of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, Pſal. 77.8. yeeld God his ſilence, and wait vpon him: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo all cenſuring is here condemned: Rom. 2.1, 2, 3. Iam. 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Vſe</hi> inſtruction: firſt, admonition to the wicked, that they haue ſome conſideration of the Lords mercies towards them. The Sun often beating vpon the ſtones, cauſeth them to haue ſome heat, though not at the heart, yet in the outward parts, and therefore a ſhame for them, if they be neuer the warmer for Gods ſilence: the wicked are worſe then little children, who when they haue gotten any thing of their parents, will away without either looke or legge: yet if they know they will haue dutie, then they doe it in ſuch faſhion, that all men may ſee their hearts another way on their game abroad. But wicked men, though they haue bin often told, that the Lord lookes for duty at their hands, yet he ſhall haue none at all: and ſurely, ſuppoſe they haue ſo good a nature, as they will take off their hatts before they ſit downe to the table, yet I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid it is more for cuſtome, then any thing els. Thus a ſenſuall mind counteth nothing ſweete, but what is taken in hugger mugger, without Gods allowance: like ſome <hi>gallants, thinke no veniſon ſweet, but that which is ſtolne:</hi> fooles they are, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the brightneſſe of the ſunne in the watter, and neuer looke vp to the body. The <hi>whelps that feed vnder the tables,</hi> will fawne vpon their maſters; if any ſmite them, they will preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flie at them: the <hi>oxe and aſſe knowes their owners,</hi> but wicked men are worſe to God then oxen, aſſes, and dogs are to them. And ſurely for the beſt of their ſpeeches, they are as I may ſay, no better then common tearmes of holines without affection, and therefore like court holy water, good words, but pay no debt. And if at any time, with <hi>Balaam,</hi> they ſee the beautie of Gods church in the dayes of Gods ſilence, then like hypocrits
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:21235:129"/>they wiſh as Balaam did, <hi>Oh, that their ſoules might die the death of the righteous, and that their eude might be like his:</hi> yet all is but a flaſh of lightning, ſoone come, ſoone gone: for there is a thorne caught in their foote, which hindreth their pretended iourney. For this loth to depart, he ſingeth vnto his own ſoule: Shall I in this calme of Gods mercie, looſe my pleaſure? in this time the coſt is cleere: but alas, to liue a godly life, makes me thinke a <hi>lyon</hi> is in the way, and therefore muſt I needs <hi>ſlippe my necke out of the collar.</hi> And thus by their high eſtimation of the preſent, they become pennie wiſe, but pound fooliſh: ſo that when they ſhall be taken away from this eſtate, they come to had I wiſt. But alas, let them know for concluſion, that they are worſe afraid, then hurt: they know not, that to phyſicke in the ſpring is the beſt time of the yeare: the vomit of the ſoule, which is the griefe of repentance, ſhal do the moſt good, while it pleaſeth the Lord to viſite them with the day of his ſilence.</p>
               <p>Secondly, here is excellent direction to the godly, firſt to praiſe God, Pſal. 136. all things muſt praiſe God, why? be cauſe <hi>his mercie endureth for euer:</hi> which is repeated in euery verſe: and ſurely this may be an excellent motiue to Chriſtians, to make them full of holy affections: for it is a great mercie of God to haue a <hi>large affection of well-doing, when we haue good oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion thereof.</hi> For God neuer ceaſeth in offering occaſion, but we often ceaſe in hauing affections. Therefore it were an excellent thing, to keepe reckoning <hi>what wo runne vpon Gods ſcore:</hi> we do it with men, but alas they are hardly found which thinke <hi>how deepe they are in Gods books,</hi> ſuch ill husbands we are for our ſoules: if I <hi>ouerſhoote my ſelfe with men,</hi> that they may haue a ſaying of me, behold an vngratefull perſon, that will cut me at the heart: but rare it is to know, how I haue ouerſhot my ſelfe with God, in forgetting his long ſilence: if <hi>ought croſſe my corrupt nature, I haue griefe at will;</hi> if I haue <hi>broken a day,</hi> and not kept touch with men, I would not looke them in the face: if my <hi>ſeruant</hi> haue loytered, he bluſheth, and is aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to come before me: and ſhall not I change my counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance? if I were diſpleaſed, my <hi>affections would come afore they
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:21235:129"/>were ſent for:</hi> but when God is diſpleaſed, euen for the abuſe of his mercies, I can not haue my affections, although I would ſend many a meſſenger for them: ſo ponderous is my corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which preſſeth downe, that vnleſſe Habour by a better ſpirit, I ſhall neuer giue the Lord the anſwer of his mercies.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore helpe our ſelues a little at theſe dead lifts: firſt, with ſome rules to ouerwraſtle them: ſecondly, with ſome motiues to blow vp our deuotion. Conſider therefore for the firſt rule, how little we are bound vnto the fleſh, Rom. 8.13. <hi>If ye liue after the fleſh, ye ſhall dye;</hi> a heauie reward for a flauiſh ſeruice: but on the other hand for the ſecond rule, ſee how we are debt-bound vnto the ſpirit; <hi>But if ye mortifie the deedes of the bodie by the Spirit, ye ſhal liue.</hi> From theſe two rules, we haue motiues innumerable and inualuable, to praiſe the <hi>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> and <hi>mercie</hi> of God: for what a miſerie would it haue bin to haue bin debt-bound to the fleſh, which rewardeth with nothing but hell, death, and damnation? therefore happie ſoules, that haue caſt off this yoke: and againe, what a ioy and felicitie to be vnder the yoke of Chriſt, and debt-bound to his ſpirit? we neede no more to make vs ſing ioyfully vnto the Lord. But alas, ſinnefull paſſions preuent our wills, and <hi>come as we ſay of foule weather, before they are ſent for:</hi> but holy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in theſe moſt admirable mercies of God. are often quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched for want of zeale: for alas, when doe we <hi>beat our braines, not ſuffering the temples of our heads to take any reſt; till we haue giuen our God ſome argument of our thankefulnes?</hi> We vſe our God, as if it skilled not greatly how he were dealt with, when he deales moſt gratiouſly with vs. If a man bids me to ſupper once a quartar, I thanke him then, and thanke him again when I am come next time after, not onely of my preſent beeing with him, but alſo of my laſt beeing with him; I tell what kind welcome, what good cheere, bidde him ſometime againe, or checke my ſelfe if I forget it: but for ſome great matter, what kindnes? what ſpeeches? what ſeruice will I tender vnto my friend? Shall one ſupper, and not daily bread? ſhall riches, and not Chriſt deſerue a thouſand thanks? for a ſmall benefit I will be at command, and ſhall I not ſurrender my ſelfe vnto God,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:21235:130"/>who hath paid my debt, and purchaſed me a new ſtocke, euen the hope of eternall life? ſhall I bluſh at ſmall vnthankfulnes towards man, and not condemne my ſelfe before God? ſurely when the Lord ſhall take away his mercies, we ſhall come to had I wiſt, and doe ſo much more penance, by how much we were more careles. We will not let goe our leaſes to men for want of payment of the rent; therefore let vs giue God no cauſe to enter and ſtraine vpon vs, and all that we haue, for not magnifying and praiſing him: and let this follow euery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of a fauour, that Dauid hath taught vs, Pſal. 136. <hi>For his mercie endureth for euer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſecond inſtruction, is to imitate God in his ſilence, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kind towards others. 1. Tim. 1.16. <hi>For this cauſe was I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued to mercie, that Ieſus Chriſt ſhould firſt ſhew on me all long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering, vnto the enſample of them, which ſhall in time to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him vnto eternall life:</hi> eſpecially Chriſtians muſt obſerue it. 2. Tit. 2.3. <hi>Shewing all meekenes vnto all men, for we our ſelues were alſo in times paſt, vnwiſe, diſobedient, ſeruing the luſts and diuers pleaſures, liuing in malitiouſnes and enuie, hatefull and hating one an other.</hi> Thus Dauid approoues himſelfe a man of God, 1. Sam. 24. by his innocencie vnto Saul, in cutting off his garment, when he might haue cut his throat. Motiues to this we haue many: Matth. 5.7. <hi>Bleſſed are the mercifull: for they ſhall receiue mercie:</hi> againe, for this ſhall they be receiued into the kingdome of heauen, Matth. 25.34. thirdly, becauſe it makes vs walke worthie of our vocation: Eph. 4.2. <hi>Walke worthie the vocation whereunto ye are called, with all humblenes of minde, and meekenes, with long ſuffering ſupporting one an other through loue.</hi> fourthly, it prooues vnto vs our election: Coloſſ. 3.12. <hi>Now therefore as the Elect of God, holy and beloued, put on tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, kindnes, humblenes of minde, meekenes, long ſuffering, &amp;c.</hi> laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this ſerues for inſtruction of all, to take care for diſpleaſing of God: Matth. 5.25. <hi>Agree with thine aduerſarie quickely, whiles thou art in the way with him, leaſt thine aduerſarie deliuer thee to the Iudge, and the Iudge deliuer thee to the ſargeant, and thou be caſt into priſon, &amp;c.</hi> Eſperially thoſe muſt looke vnto it, that haue had long time of Gods ſilence: Rom. 11. <hi>Behold therefore
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:21235:130"/>the bountifulnes and the ſeueritie of God: toward them which haue fallen ſeueritie, but toward thee bountifulnes, if thou continue in his bountifulnes, or els ſhalt thou be cut off.</hi>

Secondly, conſolation in our welfare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we haue the ſilence of God, in regard of the true cauſe of it, and therefore haue hope that it ſhall bee continued vnto vs. And thus much of Gods ſilence.</p>

<note place="margin">Silence in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the miſerie of ſinne and not of ſin it ſelfe.</note> which is either <hi>preſent,</hi> or in <hi>comming;</hi> preſent <hi>originall</hi> and <hi>actuall</hi> ſinne, wherein there hath appeared no ſilence of God; for preſently vpon the fall, man became <hi>exorbitant,</hi> and his freewill ran only vnto euill: therefore muſt it be in the puniſhment comming, which is the ſenſible miſerie of man, to wit, the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death: wherein plainly we haue the ſilence of God, firſt, in regard of the firſt death; the Lord did not preſently depriue him of all the goods of bodie, whether internall or externall: Internall; firſt, in the ſenſe of his <hi>nakedneſſe,</hi> it pleaſed God to couer him; in the loſſe of his created <hi>maieſtie</hi> wherein ſtood his ſhame, it pleaſed God a little to releeue him; for the <hi>beauty of his bodie,</hi> it pleaſed God not to make him altogether defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; for the health of his <hi>body,</hi> not preſently to make him
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:21235:131"/>wearie of his life, leauing him to dangers, filling him with diſeaſes, and ſetting the footſteps of death in him. Againe, for the <hi>externall goods</hi> of bodie, ſeruing for <hi>honeſtie</hi> and <hi>neceſſitie,</hi> were not preſently remooued: for firſt, hee left him ſome do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ouer the creatures, ſome honour and friendſhip a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelues. Laſtly, for <hi>goods,</hi> whereby his life was maintained, ſome releife from the earth, though with his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and the <hi>ſweat of his browes, from among thornes and briers:</hi> ſome from the creatures, firſt <hi>cloathing:</hi> ſecondly, <hi>poſſeſſion:</hi> though in the firſt was his ſhame, and in the ſecond calamitie and loſſe. Thus was the Lord ſilent with man in regard of the firſt death, onely concerning the incoation of it: but when the perfection came, then the voice of the Lord breakes out, as he did to the rich man, <hi>This night ſhall thy ſoule out of thy bodie, thy body to the duſt, and thy goods to their owners.</hi> Secondly, for his ſilence in regard of the ſecond death, firſt, in the incoation of it, and that in regard of the conſcience or ſome <hi>extraordinarie iudgement;</hi> in regard of the conſcience, not preſently, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of horror and feare, whereby man flieth from God, and hides himſelfe: nor dead ſecuritie, whereby there is no ſenſe of hel, but deſperate ſearing vp of the conſcience.

                  </head>
                  <p>Concerning wicked thoughts. Firſt, the originall of them.
<note place="margin">Kinds of thoughts.</note> Thoughts haue diuers conſiderations: Firſt, they are giuen to God; and that is a <hi>direct thought,</hi> whereby God firſt thinkes himſelfe, and then in himſelfe all things els. Gods knowledge and thoughts are direct of himſelfe, and indirect of all things that are not himſelfe: the reaſon, becauſe God directly knows no leſſe then himſelfe, and therefore can thinke no leſſe then himſelfe: ſo that out of himſelfe, he knowes all things, which no creature in heauen or earth is able to doe. And this thought may be called a direct thought, free from all errour and falſe hoode; becauſe it can no wayes be blinded by any <hi>externall or internall obiect,</hi> ſeeing it is tyed to none.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thought is indirect, when the thing muſt firſt be thought, and then may it thinke it ſelfe: for as in a glaſſe, firſt I muſt ſee the image of my face, and then from that my natural face; ſo in thinking, I muſt firſt ſee the image of the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:21235:133"/>vnto my vnderſtanding, and then by knowing of it I know my ſelfe to know: &amp; this is a <hi>reflexed thought,</hi> agreeing both to <hi>angels</hi> and <hi>men:</hi> and hence riſeth the poſſibilitie of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceiued, becauſe they may iudge of the obiect amiſſe: and if they doe ſo, then they iudge amiſſe of them-ſelues. Hence the Angels and Adam ouerthrew themſelues: the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels by proud thoughts of their eſtate, and in contempt and diſdaine to be <hi>miniſtring ſpirits for the good of man:</hi> Adam a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine was deceiued in neglecting of his true conformitie with Gods lawe, but thought it was to limite him from a great good in <hi>becomming</hi> like God.</p>
                  <p>A third thought is, when a man will thinke all things out of himſelfe, and through his owne corruptions: and therefore all the beames of Gods wiſedome, comming through ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt a <hi>medium,</hi> muſt appeare according to his corruption; euen as the ſunne ſhining through a glaſſe windowe which is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, reſembles the colour of the glaſſe. And thus man that would needs become like God, is in a <hi>paritie of contraries</hi> like God. God thinks himſelfe firſt, and then all things out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; ſo corrupt man will now needs thinke himſelfe, and ſo all things out of himſelf: but here lies the difference, that God being no thing bur goodneſſe it ſelfe, can thinke nothing but good thoughts: but man beeing nothing but a lumpe and maſſe of ſinne, can think nothing but euil thoughts: it is Gods happineſſe to thinke himſelfe, but mans miſerie as long as he flickes to his owne thoughts: and therefore no maruell, if the ſilence of the Lord take no better impreſſion in his mind, but become like his mind, a wicked thought. Yet obſerue this by the way, that as the beams of the ſunne comming through the glaſſe, are not changed by the glaſſe into another nature, nor lighting on the dunghill polluted by the filthines thereof; ſo the beames of Gods goodnes paſſing through the ſoule of a ſinner (though he abuſe them) yet ſtill they retaine their goodneſſe. Hence we learne three kind of thoughts, firſt a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect thought, the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a reflexed thought, the third a corrupt thought, which is meant in this place: the fountaine of corrupt thoughts is the heart, Gen. 6.5. whoſe conception is in imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:21235:133"/>the verie forming and laying of an accurſed birth: ſhewing that the frame of the heart is full of corruption: and ſecondly that his fruits are accurſed: as the conception is, ſo is the birth: for the thoughts comming fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the corrupt frame of the heart cannot be cleane but muſt needs relliſh of their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall: and therefore the holy Ghoſt hath ſtiled the verie ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of the heart to be <hi>euil, onely,</hi> and <hi>continuall,</hi> Gen. 8.21. <hi>euen from his childhood:</hi> as ſoone as we begin to vſe reaſon, wee frame euill in our hearts. Hence the cauſe plainely riſeth; want of all good thoughts, or want of all conſideration, with the concourſe of all the contraries: want of conſideration made the couetous man euen in temporall things deſtitute of all the comfort of them: Iſa. 44. the cauſe of all that ſtrange Idolatry is, v. 8. becauſe they haue not known nor vnderſtood: and v. 19. none conſidereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor vnderſtanding to ſay, how fooliſh haue I beene to <hi>burne halfe of my wood in the fire, for to bake my bread, and roſt my fleſh, and yet of the reſidue to make an abhomination to bowe vnto it,</hi> Ier. 8.4, 5, 6. There is more conſideration in the verie bruit beaſts, then in Gods Iſrael; and therefore the heart beeing ſo pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and deſtitute of all good conſideration, how ſhould it poſſibly prooue otherwiſe, then that man ſhould become full of all euill thoughts: And thus much of the fountaine, which will better be diſcouered in the other points.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond,
<note place="margin">The wayes to diſcerne of mens thoughts.</note> there bee two wayes of knowing mens thoughts, 1. <hi>immediate</hi> and direct, and this is proper vnto God, 1. Kin. 8.39. 2. <hi>indirect,</hi> and by <hi>meanes:</hi> For as God onely firſt knowes himſelfe, and then all things by himſelfe; ſo euery creature, euen angels themſelues; firſt knowe the thing, and then themſelues by the thing; this makes their knowledge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct.

                     </gap>y, and a communication of thoughts. Thus the deuill beeing a ſpirit, can come more neere our ſoules, then ſuggeſtion by obiects, euen to a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall communication: elſe tell me how it is poſſible, that the deuil can often informe ignorant perſons with the knowledg
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:21235:134"/>of tongues and artes; which cannot be done by obiects, but by familiar conuerſe of natures agreeing. And this is one dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous way, how the deuill may come to haue knowledge of out thoughts: Act. 16. how learned the woman her diuinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but from the information of the deuill? how made ſhe that confeſſion, <hi>Theſe men are the ſeruants of the moſt high God, which ſhewe vnto vs the way of ſaluation:</hi> this was not the holding out of an obiect, but effectuall operation vpon the glaſſe of her mind: therefore the deuill is ſaid to <hi>worke powerfully</hi> in the hearts of vnbeleeuers. Working by obiects cannot bee ſo powerfull: for how long might miniſters preach the way of ſaluation, before men would confeſſe as much as this woman hath done? how long might a ſchoolemaſter hold the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar before the eyes of an vnlearned man, before hee would come to vnderſtand the tongue? or any Artiſt holde the Art before an ignorant man, before he would make a ſyllogiſme, &amp;c. And therefore neceſſarily betwixt ſpirits, muſt there bee a communication. Hence the Scripture defines a witch, a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or ignorant perſon that hath a familiar ſpirit: 1. Sam. 28.7. <hi>Seeke me a woman that hath a familiar spirit.</hi>

                  <p>Beſide theſe fowre, the Papiſts haue two more: 1. Of the <hi>Saints in heauen,</hi> to wit, the <hi>glaſſe of the Trinitie:</hi> but this glaſſe was neuer reuealed vnto any, neither is it poſſible that it ſhould bee reuealed: for whatſoeuer is in God, is God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: and therefore if wee cannot ſee God according to his glorious eſſence and perfection, Iob 11.7.8.9. Exod. 33.20. <hi>Thou canſt not ſee my face; for there ſhall no man ſee mee and liue:</hi> yet may we ſee Gods backe-parts, which are his attributes, and his workes, which onely are to be ſeene in this world, and in the world to come: Therefore a meere dreame of ſeeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

Thirdly, Ioſias, 2. Kin. 4.22. <hi>was taken away, that he might not ſee the euill to come;</hi> therefore the Saints in heauen ſee not the euill dayes here vpon earth. In a word, againſt all Papiſts; God as he is one moſt ſimple act, cannot be apprehended of any creature: for God in himſelfe is infinite, therefore no finite thing can apprehend him. Secondly, he is moſt ſimple, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one: now many acts of vnderſtanding cannot apprehend this one; therfore is it abſolutely impoſſible to reach vnto God by one act of vnderſtanding, which is abſolutely neceſſarie to vnderſtand God ſimply one: therfore God alone knowes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and his creature, according as he hath reuealed himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond, the <hi>chamber of meditation,</hi> wherein they put men, and bid them meditate, and afterward they inquire of them what they thought, and ſo ſee what they are fit for; if bloodie minded, then treaſon; if deepe meditations, then Ieſuites.</p>
                  <p>A ſtrologians haue found out a ſeuenth way of knowing the thoughts, and that is <hi>by the ſtarres:</hi> but they are to know, that the ſtarres worke nothing further then their proper ſubiect, and naturall qualities; and therefore haue no worke vpon the mind, wherein the thoughts are framed: for corporall things cannot worke vpon ſpirituall things, ſaue only in the altering of their inſtruments.</p>
                  <p>An 8. meanes is invented, which we call <hi>phyſiognomie,</hi> that can tell mens deſtines by their hands, called <hi>palmeſtrie:</hi> by the

                     <p>The firſt point of thoughts concerning God.
<note place="margin">Fowre capitall thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God.</note> There are 4. capitall thoughts, and damnable imaginations that runne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally in euerie ſinners mind touching God: Firſt, that there is <hi>no God,</hi> Pſal. 10.4. and 14.1. Touching this thought, fowre things: Firſt, in whom it is? <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is in the corrupt minde, and imagination of euerie man naturally that comes of Adam: this appeares, Pſal. 14.1. for the foole in Scripture is euerre ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner vncalled and vnrepentant. Againe, Rom. 3. Paul goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to prooue that all are ſinners by proofes out of the Pſal. 10. &amp; 14. thereby intimating, that the foole is to be vnderſtood of all ſinners whoſoeuer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obiect.</hi> But nature tels euerie man that there is a God. <hi>Sol.</hi> Theſe two contrarie thoughts, may bee both in the profane mind: By nature a man thinkes that there is a God: by corrupt nature that there is no God: for two contraries may be in one ſubiect, as light and darkeneſſe, cold and heat, when neither is in the higheſt degree.</p>
                     <p>But in what manner ſhall any man deny God by his thoughts? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, by turning the true God into an Idol
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:21235:135"/>of his owne braine: and thus euery man doth by nature, Cal. 4.8. Eph. 2.12. why ſo? becauſe in heart they did not conceiue of God, nor in life worſhip him as he ought to be conceiued of and worſhipped: and therefore, Pſal. 96.4. all the gods of the Gentiles are called Idols. Now the heart of man turnes the true God into an Idol by three thoughts: 1. That God is not preſent in all places, Pſal. 10.11. <hi>Tuſh, God ſhall not ſee.</hi> Iſa. 29.15. 2. That there is no prouidence of God, whereby he obſerueth, ruleth, gouerneth, and ordereth all things on earth in particular: Pſal. 10.11. <hi>God hideth his face,</hi> Zeph. 1.12. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. That there is no iuſtice in God, as when men thinke, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſinne, yet God will not puniſh them: Deut. 29.19. Pſal. 10.3. <hi>The wicked man bleſſeth himſelfe in the deſire of his heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond way whereby a man in thought denieth God, is by placing ſome thing in the roome of the true God: Phil. 2. <hi>whoſe God is their bellie, and riches are the couetous mans idol.</hi> Col. 3.5. Epheſ. 5.5. <hi>Queſt.</hi> How can this be? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Looke what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer a man thinkes to be the beſt thing in the world for him beſides God, that is his god: thus riches and pleaſures are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the gods of men, becauſe they ſet thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> hearts vpon them, and take them for the beſt things in the world: for after affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction follows opinion. And the fruit of this thought, thus lead by affection, is <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> wherby we ſundrie waies deny God: in <hi>practiſe,</hi> in <hi>iudgement:</hi> in practiſe many are infected with this ſinne, firſt <hi>hypocrites</hi> which giue their lips and bodies to God, but hold backe their hearts: ſecondly <hi>Epicures,</hi> whereby men giue themſelues to pleaſures in eating, drinking, playing, as though they were made for nothing els: theſe, do not eate that they may liue, but liue that they may eate: thirdly, <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> who either by tradition, or expreſſe compact, worſhip the deuill: to theſe alſo belong thoſe that ſeeke vnto witches, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Atheiſme in iudgment hath three degrees: firſt, to conceiue otherwiſe of God then he hath reuealed himſelfe in his word. To this head, firſt, <hi>Turkes</hi> belong, who though they hold Chriſt more famous then any Prophet, yet will not haue him
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:21235:136"/>God: and therefore worſhip God out of the Trinitie, and ſo worſhip an Idol. Secondly of the <hi>Iewe,</hi> who though he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the true God, yet he neither acknowledgeth, nor worſhips him in Chriſt, and therefore worſhips an idol: for Ioh. 4.23. and 24. Chriſt ſaith, that the Samaritans they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip they know not what. Thirdly of the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> whoſe religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in ſubſtance and ſcope is <hi>meere Atheiſme:</hi> for in word, they acknowledge the <hi>true God,</hi> the <hi>Trinitie,</hi> the <hi>perſonall vnion</hi> of both Chriſts natures; yet if we regard their manner of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping, it is coloured and cloſe Atheiſme. As appeares by theſe two reaſons: Firſt, the god that they worſhip is no true God: for the true God is infinite in iuſtice and in mercie, but according to their doctrine he is not ſo: becauſe for the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, they hold that the ſatisfaction of ſinneful men are ſufficient to ſatisfie the iuſtice of God: and for his mercie, they make that imperfect; in that they make a ſupply to Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, by mans merit: for if Gods mercie be not euerie way mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, it is no mercie: for grace muſt euerie way be grace, els it is no way grace.</p>
                     <p>Second reaſon: the Church of the Papiſts is a falſe Church: firſt, in that they rob Chriſt of his <hi>manhood,</hi> by teaching that he is not in heauen locally, but in all places where the maſſe is offered. Secondly, they <hi>diſgrace him in his offices:</hi> in his kingly office, in that they place the Pope aboue him, his deputie in his preſence; whereas we know that all commiſſion ſtayes in the preſence of the King: ſecondly, in that they aſcribe this vnto the Pope, that his lawes bind conſcience; which is as much to take the crowne off Chriſts head, and giue it to the Pope. For his Prieſtly office, which conſiſts in ſatisfaction, and interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they likewiſe abuſe Chriſt: 1. of his ſatisfaction; becauſe they ioyne with it the ſatisfaction of men in the worke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: 2. of his interceſſion, in that they ioyne the <hi>virgine Marie</hi> an interceſſor for them in heauen: thus they degrad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> him of his offices, and ſo make him no Chriſt. Now if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Chriſt, then the faith, 1. Ioh. 2.23. and that religion that denies the faith, is no true religion, but <hi>Atheiſme</hi> in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <pb n="255" facs="tcp:21235:136"/>
                     <p> The ſecond degree of Atheiſme in iudgement, is when men place ſome creature in the roome of the true God. Thus the Gentiles worſhipped the <hi>Sunne, Moone,</hi> and <hi>ſtarres,</hi> in the roome of the true God.</p>
                     <p>The third degree in iudgement is, when a man holds and profeſſeth no God at all, the higheſt and moſt notorious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of all. Theſe are not worthie the common breath of men. For if a man that ſaies a lawfull Prince, is no Prince, muſt die for it; much more is he worthie of death, that holds God to be no God. Now by the way, let euery one of vs examine our ſelues, whether we haue any of theſe thoughts and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Euery one will ſay, I neuer diſcerned any ſuch thoughts in my ſelf: but alas, ſoone may we deceiue our ſelues: for there is in all of vs, firſt a <hi>ſingle thought,</hi> when a man ſimply thinkes this or that: ſecondly, a <hi>double and reflecting thought,</hi> when a man iudgeth and diſcernes what he thinks: the firſt belongs to the minde, the ſecond to the conſcience, which is corrupted ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and therefore can not tell certenly, but may be deceiued.</p>
                     <p>For the examination of our ſelues, we muſt proceede by certaine tokens and ſignes, whereby we may diſcerne this thought in vs: Pſal. 14.3. notes 1. a <hi>diſordered life:</hi> 2. not to call vpon Gods name: 3. contemning thoſe that put their truſt in God. If we examine our ſelues by theſe three, we ſhall find that this thought raignes among vs. For firſt, we heare the word often, but we are not amended and reformed by it: I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to mens conſciences. Secondly, men goe on in their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but neuer call vpon God; or if they doe, it is but for forme and faſhion, in a few words, at ordinarie times: but who cries with a hunger after Gods graces, or for a ſupplie of their wants. Thirdly, no loue of them that truſt in God, but their profeſſion is hated and contemned. Againe, whoſoeuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the preſence of God, it is a token he holds there is no God. In the preſence of men, we will not offend men; but in the preſence of God, we offend God. Againe, what is the cauſe that men vſe all vnlawfull meanes to get riches, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe they denie Gods prouidence. Againe, euery man
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:21235:137"/>reaſons thus; Though I goe on in my ſinnes, yet God is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull: hereby Gods iuſtice is denied, and ſo no God: for the true God is as well a God of iuſtice as of mercie. Here then we ſee what notorious ſinners we are, though we had no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſinnes: Eccles. 10.20. <hi>If a man curſe the King in his priuie chamber, the foules ſhall deuoure him:</hi> how much more horrible is it to curſe the King of kings, the God of Gods? therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one muſt labour to know, ſee, and diſcerne this wretched thought in his heart, which wee may doe by Gods grace, not onely the damnable actions of our times, but the inward thoughts of the ſpirit within vs.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond thought touching God is, that the word of God is fooliſhneſſe: this muſt eſpecially be vnderſtood of the Goſpel: 1. Cor. 1.21. Paul calls it fooliſhneſſe, according to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world; not becauſe it is ſo in it ſelfe, but in the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and imagination of the Grecian: and 2.14. that a man ſhould be ſaued, iuſtified, and ſanctified by Chriſt, is fooliſhnes to the naturall man; this alſo in part is to be vnderſtood of the lawe: Deut. 29.19. Moſes bids the people, <hi>take heed leaſt when they heare the curſes, &amp;c.</hi> where hee intimateth that this euill thought is in mens minds, to thinke that the lawe is fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and therefore not to hearken vnto the curſes thereof.</p>
                     <p>Now this is a dangerous thought, as appeares by the fruit: 1. Hence riſeth that deuilliſh opinion, that religion is but a policie to keepe men in awe from treaſons and rebellions. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, hence ſpringeth all apoſtaſie, and all departing from the faith: Gal. 1. the Galatians were a worthy Church of God planted by Paul, yet there he ſaith, that ſome of them were <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the truth;</hi> the reaſon is, becauſe they thought the word of God to be fooliſhnes. Many in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> countries, and in <hi>Aſia,</hi> where the Goſpel was planted by the Apoſtles, by this damnable thought, fell firſt into the herefie of <hi>Arrius,</hi> and many 600. yeares after <hi>Arrius,</hi> departed to the religion of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> In the <hi>Weſt</hi> church, in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Italio,</hi> the Goſpel was planted by the Apoſtles, &amp; yet afterward fell to Papiſtry: and about 600. yeares after Arrius death, Papiſme ouerſpread all Europe, except in ſome little parts of Greece; and ſo hath
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:21235:137"/>raigned till this day: the reaſon is plaine, in euery mans heart lieth this corruption, to thinke the word of God fooliſhneſſe, and hereupon men by nature can embrace any religion, but the truth. And ſo in <hi>England,</hi> let a man broach an herefie, it ſhall not onely at the firſt, but afterward haue ſtrong and ſtout pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones. When the <hi>family</hi> tooke ſhipping, and came out of <hi>Germany</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> (though it were but a very brutiſh he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refie) yet it was much broached, and had beene more, had it not beene repreſſed by the preaching of the word, and good order of godly Magiſtrates. The cauſe why men are ſo readie to entertaine a ſchiſme or hereſie is, becauſe mans heart by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is full of blindnes and error, and thinkes the Goſpel foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe and madnes.</p>
                     <p>Examination of our hearts touching this thought, beeing ſeriouſly performed, we ſhall find it to raigne in high degree: for we are all content to come to the aſſemblies where Gods name is worſhipped, and ſubmit bur ſelues to be taught: we are content to heare the preaching of the word, and herein our perſonall ſinnes diſplayed, the terrible curſes of the lawe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt them, <hi>viz.</hi> iudgements in this life, in death, and at the day of iudgement; and yet we tremble not at all this, our hearts are not amaſed and affrighted at theſe thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolts of Gods curſes due to our ſinnes. If a man in the ſtreets crie fire, our hearts will be aſtoniſhed; but when the fire of heauen, kindled by the breath of the liuing God, is cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt our ſinnes, we are not mooued: and why? ſurely our hearts are foreſtalled with a falſe imagination, that the word of God is fooliſhnes, &amp; therefore that his plagues, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and curſes, are nothing. Againe, when we heare in the Goſpel of the pardon of our ſinnes by Chriſt, and life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, repentance, the kingdome of God; few learne this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, repent, and enter into it; becauſe their mind is foreſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and wholly poſſeſſed with this falſe imagination: Pſa. 126. the Iſraelites deliuerance was a dreame, much more then is our ſpirituall deliuerance from Sathan: and no maruell; for the Goſpel is as farre contrarie to mans reaſon, as light to darknes: for that Chriſt by bearing death, and the curſe of God for ſin,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:21235:138"/>ſhould thereby free men from death and the curſe, is quite contrarie to naturall reaſon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> 2. If this be ſo, that all men naturally imagine the word to be fooliſhneſſe, then muſt we followe Pauls rule. 1. Cor. 3.18. <hi>If any man will be wiſe, let him become a foole:</hi> firſt, we muſt renounce our owne naturall reaſon, denie our ſelues our own iudgement, put out the eies of our naturall vnderſtanding, and ſuffer our ſelues wholly to bee guided by the doctrine of the Goſpel of Chriſt. Secondly, we muſt all pray with Dauid, that God would open our eyes that we may ſee his wil, and <hi>vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the words of his law:</hi> becauſe our reaſon and imagination is flat contrarie to the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>From this ſecond thought ariſeth an other, <hi>viz.</hi> that if the word be fooliſhnes, then I will performe no obedience to the word of God: That this is mans thought naturally, I prooue it thus; Iob 21.14. he brings in the ſinner, ſaying, depart, &amp;c. there is none ſo wicked to ſay ſo in word, but it is their hearts imagination and affection; and he that purpoſeth to walke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his owne wayes, he it is that ſaith, <hi>who is the Lord that wee ſhould worſhip him?</hi> It is a diſgrace for me to bee the ſeruant of God, I will not doe it, therefore depart from me, O God, Ier. 6.16. they ſay ſo in the purpoſe of their hearts: Luk. 19.14. which place as it is meant of the Iewes, ſo of all other men in the world by nature, that are impenitent ſinners: for ſo long as a man goes on without repentance, hee carries a purpoſe in heart to liue in his ſinnes, and ſo ſaith in heart, I will not beare the yoake of Chriſt, I will be none of his ſubiects, he ſhall not raigne ouer me. Come to an adultreer, drunkard, &amp;c. tell him of his ſinne, he will ſtraight ſwell like a toade, and ſhewe the malice of his heart to him that reprooues him: reaſon, becauſe he meaneth to liue in his ſinnes, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Examination of our hearts touching this thought. Moſt will ſay, they defie and abhorre all ſuch wicked thoughts of not ſeruing God: but after examination had, it will be found that it raignes in our hearts. We can bee content to heare the word, receiue the Sacraments, which are the pledges of Gods ſauour, and mercie in Chriſt; and wee are content to looke for
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:21235:138"/>ſaluation in Chriſt: but what is the cauſe why after all this, there is ſo little obedience, ſo litle knowledge and conſcience, ſo little mercy and compaſſion, ſo little iuſtice and loue in our callings? ſurely this, becauſe our hearts are wicked, deceitful, full of guile: and what is this guile? I will not obey the waies of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> If this be the well wiſhed thought of mens hearts, then we may ſee what a wonderful hard thing it is to conuert a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: a man may be a long hearer of the word, and by hearing, his mind may be furniſhed with knowledge, with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, with verie good vtterance, ſo that he may teach and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the Goſpel, and conceiue prayer, and that verie well, and yet this damnable imagination may lurke in his heart; &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he may not onely hereby deceiue others, but euen his owne ſoule: for ſo long as this thought is in his ſoule, hee is voide of true repentance: for where true repentance is, there is a reſolution to pleaſe God in all things.</p>
                     <p>Third thought touching God: <hi>It is a vaine thing to worſhip God,</hi> Iob. 21.15. he ſpeakes it not with the mouth, but in the heart: Matth. 3.14. Nay, <hi>Dauid,</hi> Pſal. 73.13. had this thought in his heart; now I ſee I am deceiued, <hi>In vaine haue I worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped God:</hi> but yet this thought comes not into mans heart at all times, but vpon occaſion, as when the godly ſeeth the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked flouriſh.</p>
                     <p>Examination. This thought takes great place in our hearts: for goe to the poore mans family, he works and toyles all day to get riches, but neuer worſhippeth God, or calls vpon his name: why ſo? becauſe the heart ſaith, ſo I may haue wealth it is no matter whether I ſerue God, or no. Come to the rich mans houſe, there is nothing but <hi>eating, drinking, ſleeping, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,</hi> and the like: why ſo? becauſe his heart ſaith, all is wel, ſo I may haue my pleaſure: it is enough for me, it is no matter for Gods worſhip. The ordinarie man ſaith, he will do as his anceſtors haue done; he hath as good a faith as the beſt, hee will not come to ſermons, for they that haunt ſermons moſt, are vſually the worſt diſpoſed perſons, and none ſo bad as they. If a man profeſſe Chriſt in ſinceritie, hee is a by-word,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:21235:139"/>and a mocke to men. Nay almoſt all men betake themſelues to will-worſhip, not onely the <hi>Papiſt, Iewe,</hi> and <hi>Turke,</hi> but the common Proteſtant; he comes to Church, and ſerues God by mumbling ouer the Creede, the Lords praier, and the tenne Commandements; thereby thinking to ſerue God as well as the beſt: the cauſe is, becauſe this imagination taking place in the heart, hindereth all good things in vs.</p>
                     <p>Fourth thought, is the thought of diſtruſt, and it runnes much in the mind of man: God doth not regard me, God will not helpe me, God will not be mercifull vnto me. This made an entrance to the fall of our firſt parents: for firſt, Eue lookes vpon the fruit, and ſees it to be very beautifull. 2. There enters into her heart a thought of diſtruſt, <hi>viz.</hi> It may be there is no ſuch danger in eating this fruit as the Lord faith there is, and it may be God doth not regard vs. When the Iſraclites mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured at the waters of ſtrife, Numb. 20.12. Moſes was barred the Land of Canaan for this diſtruſt: for when hee ſmote the rocke, (as God had commanded him) he thought in his heart, God will not giue water though I ſtrike the rocke: Dauid, Pſa. 31.23. &amp; Pſal. 78.2. is full of ſpirituall confidence: but in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place ſaies, <hi>I thought all men were lyers; Samuel</hi> the Lords Prophet hath deceiued mee; now I ſee that Samuel ſpake not by the ſpirit of God as aprophet, but by his own ſenſe lyingly, when he ſaid that I ſhould come vnto the kingdome of Iſrael: Thus Dauid did not openly diſtruſt God, but Samuel; as if he had not knowne Gods will, but had paſſed beyond the bonds of his calling. Matth. 14. why did Peter ſinke when Chriſt bad him come to him on the water? becauſe his minde was troubled with the thought of diſtruſt; it may be God will not helpe me now walking vpon the ſea: Chriſt reprooues this, <hi>why didſt thou doubt?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Touching this thought two points: 1. the time when it was in mans thought: 2. the danger of it: For the firſt, it takes place in the time of <hi>danger, temptation, aduerſitie, ſickeneſſe,</hi> and <hi>death:</hi> it troubled Iob in his affliction, Iob 16. when he ſaid, <hi>God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth me, hee is myne enemie, hee makes me a but:</hi> Pſalm. 77.9. <hi>It may be God will no more haue mercie vpon me.</hi> In peace Sathan
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:21235:139"/>tempts by preſumption. The dangers hereof, 1. <hi>horrors of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> and all feares and aſtoniſhments of the heart, which come when the minde diſtruſteth. 2. <hi>Deſperation,</hi> whereby men confidently auouch, that God hath forſaken them, and that he hath cut them off, and that nothing remaines but death: this is often in the heart of repentant ſinners. 3. It weakens the foundation of our ſaluation, which ſtands in the certentie of Gods promiſes; and thus it doth by weakning faith, for by faith we beleeue that God is our Sauiour, and that Chriſt ſhed his blood for vs in particular: now this thought is cleane contrarie to faith, as fire to water; and where diſtruſt preuailes, there ſhall be no faith: hence appeareth the great danger.</p>
                     <p>We muſt take heede of it,
<note place="margin">Remedie.</note> and vſe all meanes in the daies of our peace, that it raignes not in our hearts in the daies of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The meanes are three: 1. the <hi>preaching</hi> of the <hi>Gospel:</hi> this is the eſpeciall meanes to applie Gods mercie truly to our ſoules and conſciences: therefore a ſoueraigne remedie againſt this thought: for the ſpeach of the miniſter, is as though God himſelfe ſpake, by vertue of the very ordinance of God: if God ſhould ſay to me in his owne voice, my mercie belongs to the beleeuer, I would ſurely beleeue and not doubt: now whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the miniſter ſaith, beleeue in God, &amp; his mercie belongs to thee, it is by the power of this ordinance of God, as if God himſelfe had ſaid it. 2. <hi>Baptiſme:</hi> if a Prince ſhall giue a man a pardon, and put his name and ſeale to it, he will neuer doubt, but aſſure himſelfe of pardon: now when a man is baptized, God puts the parties name in the pardon, and his owne ſeale to the pardon of his ſinnes in Chriſt. 3. The <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> wherein the bread and wine are particular pledges of Gods particular mercie, to euery particular receiuer: and therefore it is, that euery particular man receiues for himſelfe in ſpeciall.</p>

                     <p>Of euill thoughts, touching our <hi>neighbour.</hi> To finde out what theſe be, we muſt haue recourſe to the commandements, eſpecially to the ſecond Table. Theſe beeing ſpirituall, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne not onely wicked actions, words, and affections, but
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:21235:140"/>alſo the wicked thoughts of man againſt man. And they are of two ſorts in the ſecond table. Firſt, thoughts without conſent. Secondly, with conſent. Without conſent, hath the firſt moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and inclinations in the mind, forbidden in the tenth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement; Thoughts with conſent, are thoſe wherein the wil conſenteth with the firſt motions: theſe as they are concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, ſo are they practiſed: and are forbidden in the 6.7.8.9. Commandements. 1. Thought, is of <hi>diſhonour,</hi> againſt the 5. commandement: the 2. of <hi>murther,</hi> againſt the 6. the 3. of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie,</hi> againſt the 7. the 4. of <hi>theft,</hi> againſt the 8. the 5. of <hi>diſgrace,</hi> againſt the 9.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Is any thought that tendeth to the contempt and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the perſon of our neighbour; and that is a baſe eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the perſons of our inferiours in reſpect of our ſelues: Luk. 18.11. the learned and zealous Phariſie thinkes baſely of the Publican: this thought is like to <hi>Adonibezek,</hi> who ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in his royaltie, had diuers kings with their thombs cut off receiuing meat of him vnder the table, as dogs. Pride makes a man deſtitute of all friends: he hath neither <hi>God,</hi> nor his <hi>neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> nor <hi>himſelfe:</hi> he that hath not God, what happineſſe can he haue? he that hath not his neighbour, what ſocietie can he haue? and not to haue himſelfe, is to be a ſlaue, when he thinks he domineers ouer all. Therfore with Iob learne to ſay, <hi>Lord I am vile:</hi> when we can ſay this &amp; ſee it, it will be a meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe this thought. Iob 39.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Thought of murther, is any intent of murthering his neighbour, or any thing tending to murther: Deuter. 15.9. where two ſignes are laide downe of it; firſt an euill eye, to looke vpon the poore without compaſſion: ſecondly, vnmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull dealing. A ſecond, is the thought to doe ſome hurt to them, that worſhip God truly, Pſal. 74.8. the Babylonian ſpeakes againſt the Iew, <hi>Let vs deſtroy them altogether:</hi> Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Ye ſhall be hated of all men for my names ſake:</hi> this hath bin ſince the time of righteous Abel. This thought proceeds from an other, ſet downe 1. Pet. 4.4. <hi>the wicked maruell that others will not doe as they doe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ob.</hi> Nebuchadnezzar a wicked man, fauoured Daniel. <hi>Anſ.</hi>
                        <pb n="263" facs="tcp:21235:140"/>Dan. 1.9. it was Gods prouidence that diſpoſed the Kings heart to doe good.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Murdering thought, is when a man thinks the Miniſter ripps vp his ſinne in malice.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thought, of adultery, as all vnchaſt thoughts. 4. thought, theft, Pſal. 50.18. when thou ſeeſt a theefe, thou runneſt with him: this ſeeing makes him runne in thought and deede. 5. thought diſgrace, to thinke a thing well done ill done, or ill done well done, 1. Sam. 1.13. and v. 17.28. Matth. 19.4. Act. 2.13. yet loue thinkes no euill, which beeing wanting amongſt men, makes them thinke all euill. Mens hearts are like drie wood, which burne not alone, but put the leaſt cole to them and they will burne; ſo the leaſt occaſion offered, wil ſet all on fire. This thought of diſhonour, is as the table of Adonibezek: in reſpect of murther, it is a meere ſlaughter-houſe; in reſpect of the thought of adulterie, a meere ſtew; in reſpect of theft, a den of theeues; and in reſpect of the thought of diſgrace, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie fountaine of all backbiting, ſlaundering, reuiling, &amp;c.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>thought of pride,</hi> thinking himſelfe moſt excellent: I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa. 14.13. Zeph. 2.15. Luk. 18.11. Reu. 18.7. Gen. 3. our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents learned this leſſon of the deuill, You ſhall be as gods: and the leſſe we ſee it, the more it raignes in vs. Pride in outward apparell, is a moſt damnable pride, but none aboue ſpirituall pride: from hence ſprung many ſinnes, and therefore to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred. As 1. ambition, whereby men are not content with their owne eſtate, but ſeeke to be aduanced. 2. preſumption, in daring things aboue his calling. 3. boaſting. 4. hypocriſie. 5. obſtinacie. 6. contention. 7. affectation of nouelties. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when this thought raignes in vs, Gods ſpirit can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not dwel in vs, Luk. 1.51, 52. Iam. 4.6. Iſa. 66.2. Thirdly, when all other ſinnes die in vs, this thought dies not: nay, when the graces of God come, this thought reuiues, becauſe he makes them matter of his pride.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The higheſt degree of this is, when a man thinkes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe check-mate with God, Iſa. 14.14. two waies: firſt, when
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:21235:141"/>he thinks he may haue power to preuaile with, or againſt God, Dan. 3.15. Exod. 5.2. Secondly, taking honour due vnto God vnto themſelues, Act. 12.22, 23. 2. Theſſ. 2. Antichriſt ſits in the Temple of God as God. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But he is <hi>ſervus ſervorum. Anſ.</hi> It is not in word, but in the thought of his heart; in that he thinks he hath power to make lawes binding conſcience, to diſpenſe with the morall law, and Apoſtolicall conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to forgiue ſinnes; hereby he thinks himſelfe to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall with God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Thought; I am righteous, and neede no repentance, Deut. 9.4. two things: firſt, that a man thinks himſelfe by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture righteous: ſecondly, that the Lord giues them all that they haue for their righteouſnes, Ier. 2.25. Reuel. 3.17. Chriſt came not to call theſe righteous, becauſe their imagination was ſuch, that they were vncapable of his grace. The angels reioyce more for one penitent ſinner, then for nintie nine that neede no repentance. Come to an ignorant man, aske him, can you keepe the law? yea: and that he lookes to be ſaued by this righteouſnes, and by the works of the law. Hence we ſee how euery man by nature is a Papiſt. Secondly, this ſheweth vs that it is a very difficult point, to bring a man to true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation. Thirdly, we ſee why men neglect the preaching of the Goſpel, becauſe it teacheth a ſtrange doctrine vnto cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt reaſon.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thought of ſecuritie; I proſper, and am free from all Gods iudgements: I am not in danger of hell, death, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: Pſal. 10.6. Iſa. 28.15. Pſal. 30.7. This makes the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters labour in vaine, Zeph. 3.5. Noe an hundreth and twentie yeares.</p>
                     <p>Fourth thought in miſerie, to thinke my croſſes to be worſe then indeede they are: Iob. 6.3. come to comfort them, <hi>Oh neuer man was vexed as I am.</hi> The cauſe of theſe is, Gen. 6.5. &amp; v. 21. the heart, which ſometimes ſignifieth the fleſhie part of man, which is the beginning of vitall blood placed in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the body. 2. the ſoule. 3. the faculties. 4. the middle of any thing Pſal. 46.2. but here is meant the vnderſtanding, wil, and affections: Epheſ. 4.23. imaginations: this word ſheweth
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:21235:141"/>the frame of the heart: firſt, for his corruption. 2. for his fruits. 3. tearmed mans heart, not euil men alone, or thoſe before the flood; but all men naturally. 4. word euill, that is againſt Gods lawe. 5. from his childhood; as ſoone as he beginnes to vſe reaſon, he frames euill in his heart. Hence the cauſe plainely riſeth; want of all good thoughts, or want of all conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: this is the mother ſinne; we muſt keep all the morall law, euen in thought, Luk. 10.27. the want of this may be ſeene in matters earthly. 2. in matters ſpiritually: in matters earthly, Eccleſ. 4.8. in regard of their natures, ends, and vſes: but in ſpirituall things, there is an abſolute want. 1. Is want of the conſideration of Gods <hi>preſence,</hi> and <hi>prouidence</hi> in regard of our ſinnes, Hoſ. 7.2. 2. In regard of Gods <hi>iudgements;</hi> for men neuer thinke of iudgement in this life, nor in the life to come. An 120. yeares <hi>Noah</hi> preached, yet no conſideration; Luk. 12. the rich man neuer thought that his ſoule was in danger. 3. Is in <hi>reſpect of a mans owne ſinnes:</hi> for we cannot turne our eyes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our owne boſomes, Ier. 8.6. 4. Is want of <hi>thinking of this duty toward God,</hi> Ierem. 5.24. ſo the fooliſh virgins contented themſelues with their lampes vnprepared, neuer thinking of the oyle, till the time of grace was paſt; thus hardneſſe of heart and ſecuritie, bring forth theſe wicked thoughts. Hence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the ſtrange opinion of the world: men haue good hearts, meanings, intents, and purpoſes, howſoeuer the actions of their liues be faultie. Hence learne, that the Scriptures are no policies of men; for nothing could reueale theſe wicked thoughts, but the diuine truth: <hi>Angels</hi> and men know not the thoughts. Secondly, learne that thoughts are not free, though they neuer come into conſent or action: therefore repentance of thoughts is neceſſarie, Ioel 2.12. Act. 8.22. 1. Theſſ. 5. Paul requires that they be <hi>ſanctified in bodie, ſoule, and ſpirit.</hi>

Therefore make a couenant with thy ſenſes, that they be no occaſion or prouocation to any manner of ſinne; this did Iob, cap. 31. and Dauid, Pſal. 119. <hi>Turne mine eies from beholding couetouſneſſe:</hi> the ſenſes are the windowes of the ſoule, and if God enter not, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than will creepe in at them into our hearts. 2.

Paul bids the Philippians, haue <hi>their conuerſation in heauen:</hi> Iam. 4. <hi>drawe neere to God.</hi> Hence the Lords Supper is a principall meanes of the eleuation of the heart and mind vnto God: this eleuation muſt be continually practiſed: ſuch as are appointed to keepe clockes, doe often e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day pull vp the waights, becauſe they are alwaies going

                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Rule.</hi> The meditation of ſome ſpeciall matters, whereby ſaluation may be furthered: which is either concerning God, or our ſelues; concerning God, <hi>his preſence;</hi> this made <hi>Dauid</hi> to drawe neere vnto God, Pſal. 139. Pſal. 19. his heart is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by ſeeing God in his lawe, Pſal. 23. in the ſhadow of death he wil not feare. 2. Conſideration of Gods iudgments; not old, but late, and particular vpon perſons, cities, townes: we ſhould lay theſe to the heart, Ier. 12.11. Here we muſt pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe three things; 1. wee muſt obſerue, and carefully marke and remember Gods iudgements. 2. wee muſt apply them to our owne perſons in particular, that they may make vs afraid. Thus <hi>Habacuk</hi> when he heard of Gods iudgement, his knees beate one againſt another, Hab. 3. If in a familie one child be beaten, others will take heed. 3. We muſt make vſe of them, Luk. 13.3. Third conſideration, is of Gods word; Pſal. 1. It is the propertie of the righteous man to <hi>meditate in Gods lawe, day and night:</hi> Luk. 2. <hi>Marie hid all thoſe things in her heart.</hi> 1. we muſt conſider the ſence of the Scriptures. 2. what experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence we haue had of the truth of the word of God in our own liues and conſciences. 3. how farre forth we haue ſwarued in the practiſe of the word; or how farre forth we haue practiſed it. Fourth conſideration, is of Gods works in vs, and vpon vs, this will make vs conſider the workes of creation, preſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, prouidence: Iſa. 5.12. he pronounceth a woe to them that forget this. 1. Conſider the work of creation: God hath made vs men, when we might haue beene beaſts: that of nothing he made vs to be ſomething. 2. for preſeruation and prouidence, we muſt conſider how he hath preſerued vs from time to time from all dangers, and hath giuen vs all things neceſſarie for this life, and the life to come. 3. for his patience, that he hath not caſt vs into hell, but hath giuen vs a long, and large time
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:21235:143"/>of repentance. 4. that wee are not borne among the heathen, but in the boſome of the church, where hee hath giuen vs his word, reformed our iudgments, mollified our hearts, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked vs to euerie good worke, Eccleſ. 7.13. Pſal. 77.12.13.</p>
                     <p>Second conſideration of our ſelues: 1. of our owne particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſinnes, whether they be corruptions of the heart, or ſinnes of our liues, Pſal. 119.59. Lam. 3. <hi>Come, let vs ſearch and try our wayes.</hi> 1. In what manner we haue ſinned againſt God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ignorance or knowledge, of preſumption or weaknes, of conſtraint or wilfulneſſe. 2. The greatneſſe of euerie ſinne, yea of the leaſt ſinne, how the infinite maieſtie of God is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and his iuſtice violated. 3. The number of them: and here we ſhall find them with Dauid, more then the <hi>haires of our head,</hi> or the <hi>ſands of the ſea.</hi> Muſt a man conſider them whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is ſure they are pardoned? yes, ſo did Dauid, Pſal. 25. <hi>Hee praied for the pardon of the ſinnes of his youth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That this may take the deeper impreſſion, let vs conſider of the degrees of our miſery. 1. A ſeparation from all fellowſhip with God, Iſa. 59.2. 2. a ſocietie and fellowſhip with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and his angels; which ſtands in this, that a man by nature beares the image of Sathan, and performes homage vnto him in the practiſe of all ſin. 3. all manner of calamities; in this life ſickenes of body, damages and loſſes, in name, in goods, and in friends. 4. the horror of a guiltie conſcience, which is euen a beginning of hell fire: for firſt it is a mans accuſer, accuſing him for his ſinnes. 2. his iudge in the roome of God, giuing ſentence againſt him in his life. 3. the hangman, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth eternanally. 4. the ſecond death, which is an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the wrath of God eternally in bodie and ſoule.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Of our particular temptations, wherewith Sathan daily aſſaults vs, 1. Pet. 5.8. If enemies ſhould inuade the land, we would conſider what place of the land is weakeſt, and lay all hold to that: ſo Sathan labouring againſt vs daily, wee muſt examine what is the weakeſt part of our hearts, and by what ſinne he is moſt able to make breach into them; and then by Gods grace we ſhall vſe ſome ſtrength againſt them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Conſideration, of our particular ends, Exod. 32.29. 1.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:21235:143"/>the time of our end, that is moſt vncertaine. 2. the place like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe vncertaine: <hi>Ahab repented when hee heard of his ende;</hi> ſo did <hi>Nineueh;</hi> and ſo muſt we all.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Conſideration, of our reckoning in the laſt iugement. A trauel er comes to an inne, hauing but one pennie in his purſe, yet he calls for the beſt meate, and ſpends moſt ſumptuouſly: will not euery man iudge him to be void of all conſideration? Thus deale men in the world; ſpend all that God hath giuen them, neuer thinking of the day of reckoning: yet Paul Acts, 24. conſidering this, <hi>kept a good conſcience before God and man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Of our eſtate, whether we be members of the kingdome of darkneſſe, or of grace. A man may liue in the Church, and yet belong to Sathans kingdome.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Rule.</hi> We muſt labour in our hearts to be aſſured of our particular reconciliation to God in Chriſt: this aſſurance or certificate of the ſpirit, is commonly called <hi>faith:</hi> Now when this particular aſſurance is ſetled in them, it will purifie them: for <hi>faith purifies the heart,</hi> affections, and thoughts: for a man beeing thus aſſured, will reſolue neuer to offend God any more, but to honour and obey him euen in his thoughts. 3. Obſerue from hence, that mens beſt thoughts, are grieuous ſinnes againſt God. 4. <hi>Vſe.</hi> All Readers or ſtudents in Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie ought to humble themſelues before God, and pray that he would open their eyes, and teach them the wonders of his law, before they attempt to ſtudie and read the Scriptures; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of man by nature are wicked: yea what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer his heart ſtudieth, frameth, or inventeth. Pſal. 119. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid at leaſt tenne times prayes to God, that he would reueale to him the ſtatutes and wonders of his lawe. This example ought to be a patterne and preſident to all ſtudents of diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, neuer to read or meditate in the Scriptures, before they haue prayed to God to open the eies of their vnderſtanding, that they may rightly diſcerne of that which they reade.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obſ.</hi> The doctrine is cleare and euident, that an hypocrit or any wicked man cannot thinke a good thought: for he looks through his owne corruption, and therefore as he is diſpoſed, ſo muſt all be that comes to his vnderſtanding, will, or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:21235:144"/>Againe, his practiſe is lewd, therefore his thoughts muſt be anſwerable: for he cannot do otherwiſe then he thinketh. Thirdly, the heart, which is the fountaine, is framing thoughts which are euill; in their kind, <hi>all,</hi> in their extent, <hi>onely, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and from his infancie.</hi> Fourthly, there is no confideration of Gods <hi>preſence,</hi> of Gods <hi>iudgements,</hi> of his owne <hi>ſinnes,</hi> or the <hi>duties</hi> he oweth vnto God. Fiftly, when he thinks of God, he is <hi>profane;</hi> when of his neighbour, <hi>vnrighteous;</hi> when of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>proud, hautie,</hi> and <hi>inſolent.</hi> Let God be good vnto him in temporall fauours, be ſilent at his ſinnes, vſe compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; offending, gentleneſſe; in his iuſtice remembring mercie; patience, moſt gently ſuffering him in his ſinnes, and deferring the puniſhment: longanimitie, a long time exſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his repentance: and laſtly bountifullneſſe, beeing rich in goodneſſe, and powring forth his good gifts vpon him: yet for all theſe, he hath not one good thought to beſtowe vpon God.</p>
                     <p>Let his neighbours liue quietly by him, offer him no wrong, do him the beſt kindneſſe he can, aduiſe him by good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; yet can he not ſo much as afford him a good thought: laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let his conſcience checke him, and cauſe ſome hote ſtirres within him; yet he will checke his conſcience againe, and put it to ſilence with a wicked thought, againſt himſelfe and his owne ſoules ſaluation. Where then is his free will of doing good, if he cannot thinke a good thought to do himſelf good? will he, thinke you, buſie his braine, and ſet his temples a working to pleaſe God? no aſſuredly: for iudgement, will, and affections, which are the principles of our actions, are wholly taken away: Rom. 3. <hi>There is none that vnderſtandeth;</hi> therefore no iudgement in ſpirituall matters. Secondly, <hi>none that ſeeketh God;</hi> their will &amp; affections are eſtranged. Thirdly, <hi>all haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, and are made vnprofitable;</hi> there the power and endeuour are wanting, 1. Cor. 2.14. <hi>The naturall man perceiueth not the things of God;</hi> there is want of iudgement. Rom. 8.5. they that liue after the <hi>fleſh,</hi> ſauour the things of the <hi>fleſh;</hi> there the will is meerely carnall. Phil. 2. <hi>God worketh both will and deed.</hi> Ezek. 36.26. <hi>God giues the heart.</hi> Rom. 7.14. man is carnall, the law

Man therefore hauing no prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of good thoughts, and that which is to be thought vpon beeing ſpirituall, and he carnall, and hauing ſixe moſt woefull counſellers, foure at home with him in his owne breaſt; as the fleſh, which can no waies ſauour the things of God, and therefore doth alwaies intreat for obedience to his owne Iuſts: ſecondly concupiſcence, wherby the fleſh is made more ſtrong and effectuall to command: thirdly, a carnall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe againſt Gods wiſedom: fourthly, a Queene, or rather an vſurping Iezable, to ſet vp her throne in the ſoule, to informe and command what ſhall be done: and laſtly, two outward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies that creepe neere vnto the walls of the ſoule, as the deuill, and the world, full of polices and great in ſtrength: how ſhould it be poſſible that the ſoule ſhould reſiſt? nay alas, the watch and ward is wholly neglected: and therfore ful poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion is giuen vnto the enemies. This doctrine then doth ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ouerturne all free-will. This doctrine hath two branches, the firſt, that all the thoughts of wicked men are corrupt and wicked; the ſecond, that a good thing by accident, may be the cauſe of euill: for, Thou thoughteſt, in this place, is brought in as a conſequent of Gods ſilence.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Doct. <hi>All mens thoughts by nature are ſinnfull:</hi> this doctrine is alreadie cleared, for theſe reaſons haue beene formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The fountaine is altogether vncleane, and who can bring that which is pure out of corruption? not one of a thouſand: ſurely none but God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Man is depriued of all good conſideration, and therfore nothing is in his heart, but the conſideration how to doe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. Nothing can extend it ſelfe beyond his nature; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore man beeing carnall, and ſold vnder ſinne, cannot get vp ſo high in his meditations, as the lawe of God which is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Doct.</hi> A good thing, by accident may be the cauſe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill; as ſilence the cauſe of this thought: Hoſ. 7.1. <hi>When I would haue healed Iſrael, then the impietie of Ephraim was diſcouered, &amp;c.</hi> God here put on the perſon of a Phyſitian, who while he goes about to heale the maladie makes it worſe, and finds the euill to be more gricuous. 1. Becauſe he finds the patient more peruerſe, and to vſe all ill diet. 2. the diſeaſe beeing ſtirred, and ſo ſturdie in his owne nature, that it rebells againſt the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. Rom. 7.8. ſinne is dead without the law, but the law makes it to liue: hence wee ſee that God would heale vs, but
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:21235:145"/>we turne our diſeaſe into putrifaction and rottenneſſe, and ſo become incurable: and no maruaile; for though all men bee made of one mettall, yet they bee not caſt all in one mould: there is framed of the ſelfe ſame clay, as well the tile to keepe out water, as the pot to containe licour: the brickie nature of man will not be waſhed by Gods raine from heauen: it ſhall haue no entrance into his ſoule. The Sunne doth harden the durt, and melt the waxe; ſo the wicked being the filth of the world, cannot be ſtamped with the beames of Gods wiſdome, but are hardened: Fire maketh the gold to ſhine, and the ſtraw to ſmother; perfumes refreſh the doues, but kill the beetles: ſo the fire of Gods word ſmothereth in the wicked, and the verie ſweetneſſe of it kills them. The vine will ſpread by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the more we ſeeke by art to alter it, the more in the ende we ſhall augement it: It is proper for the palme tree to mount; the heauier we load it, the higher it ſprouteth: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though yron be made ſoft with fire, it turneth to his hardnes: the ſilly mouſe wil by no manner of meanes be tamed: the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till fox may wel be beaten, but neuer broken from ſtealing his pray: ſeaſon the wood neuer ſo well, the wine will taſt of the caske: tranſlate the crabbe-tree, where and whenſoeuer you pleaſe, and it will neuer beare ſweet apple: the blacke will take no other colour: the ſtone <hi>Abeſton</hi> beeing once made hot, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer will be made cold: can the Ethiopian change or alter his skinne? the Leopard his hew? it is impoſſible to gather grapes on thrones, or figs on thiſtles; this cannot be brought to paſſe by any art: the ſtone in Scicilia, the more it is beaten, the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it is; ſo the more God handles the wicked, the worſe they are. He that ſtoppeth the ſtreame, cauſeth it to ſwell higher: he that caſteth water on the fire in the ſmiths forge, maketh it to flame fiercer: ſo is it with the wicked, touch them and they ſparkle in your face. But alas, they know not how the wound that bleedeth inwardly is moſt dangerous; that the fire kept moſt cloſe, burneth moſt furiouſly: that the ouen dammed vp, baketh ſooneſt; that ſores hauing no vent feſter ſecretly: Thus they ſwallow the baite which will breed their bane; they ſwill the drinke that wil expire their date: the Scorpion can feed on
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:21235:146"/>the earth; the quaile can be fat with poyſon: but alas, their food bee it neuer ſo good, yet they wil ſat vp themſelues with it againſt the day of ſlaughter. Thus then good things are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to the wicked to their ruine: The fire is an eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t moſt neceſſary, yet the wicked houſholder may as wel make it burn his houſe, as burne in it: tryacle doth as well poyſon as help, if it be taken out of time: wine immoderately taken kills the ſtomacke, enflames the liuer, and miſcheifes the drunkard: Phyſicke deſtroyes if it be not well tempered: Lawe accuſeth if it be not wel interpreted: poyſon is taken out of the hunny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuckle by the ſpyder, venome out of the roſe by a canker, dung out of the maple tree by the ſcorpion: ſo the greateſt wickedneſſe, out of the greateſt good if it be abuſed. O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I intreat you that haue beene deceiued by your own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the glaſſe of peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; or deluded by your own thoughts, the gates of perdition; be as earneſt to ſeeke a medicine, as you were eager to runne into a miſchiefe: God hath left as well <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diue</hi> to delight and cure, as <hi>hemlocke</hi> to endanger; the roſe to diſtill, as well as the nettle to ſting, the bee to giue hony as the ſpider to yeld poyſon: ſo for the ſoule, as well a word to ſaue, as to deſtroy. Indeede, by accident wee make it to bee ſo: and if hitherto wee haue wounded our ſelues by it, let vs now leaue the point of this ſword, and catch it by the handle. The Poets affirmed that <hi>Achilles ſpeare</hi> could as well heale, as hurt: I am ſure this can a great deale better heale then hurt: the <hi>Scorpion</hi> though he ſtings, yet he ſtints the paine: though the <hi>hearb Nerius</hi> poyſon ſome beaſts, yet is it a remedie to man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt poyſon: therefore if we haue made the word of God a Scorpion to ſting vs, yet let vs now make it a lenitiue to ceaſe the paine; if we like beaſts haue poyſoned our ſelues, yet now like men created for God, let vs recouer our ſelues againe by this word of life. But to proceed: Thou thoughteſt, this is the conſequent of Gods ſilence, not proper, but by accident for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and befide the ſcope of it: therfore this wicked thought of an hypocrite, argueth ſtrange corruption of heart; that can frame no obiect vnto it ſelfe, that ſhall make good thoughts. Surely, affections haue gotten the maſterie ouer the mind, ſo
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:21235:146"/>that now it muſt become a ſlaue to ſerue them; and diſpoſe it ſelfe, that all his iudgments may aime at their ſatisfaction: and thus the good word of God, by accident becomes the cauſe of ſinne. Gen. 3. hath God ſaid, Yee ſhall not eate of the tree of knowledge of good and euill? the Lord by this law debars you of great good; for it is certaine, when yee cate, yee ſhall beas gods, knowing good and euill: therefore the law is too ſtrict, and rather an hinderer then furtherer of your good. Men we ſee are very quiet, vntil they be prouoked by the preaching of the lawe: <hi>Steuen</hi> Act. 7. ſhall be ſtoned for his good ſermon; Chriſt ſhall be an enemie to church and common-wealth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſpeaks againſt the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſies; Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> ſhalbe hated of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> for preaching a deliuerance; <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> for telling <hi>Herod</hi> his ſinne: <hi>Elias</hi> ſhall be <hi>Ahabs</hi> enemy for telling him the truth: and <hi>Paul</hi> ſhall become an enemie to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> for telling them of their apoſtacie from Chriſt: thus <hi>lawe,</hi> and <hi>Goſpel: mercie,</hi> and <hi>iudgement;</hi> are abuſed of the wicked: yet for all this, the law is holy and iuſt: as for example, a man that holds a glaſſe in his hands, as long as it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eſts there, is ſafe; but if they throwe it againſt the wall, the wall will breake it, but the ſault will reſt in the hands: ſo when we take our ſelues &amp; daſh our ſelues againſt Gods law, the law breaks vs, but the fault is in our ſelues: the bankes are no cauſe of the furie and rage of the waters, but the waters themſelues: ſo the lawe of God that banks in our corruption, is no cauſe why it rageth, but the nature of it, which can indure no limits.</p>

                        <hi>Reaſons.</hi> 1. Becauſe ſinne will indure no law.

Thirdly, <hi>it exacts perfect obedience,</hi> which our nature can not away withall: to loue God with all our hearts, with all our ſoules, with all our minde, and our whole ſtrength, is a leſſon that will neuer be learned or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, the <hi>diuerſitie of ſubiects:</hi> the ſelfe ſame <hi>ſeed</hi> is ſowne in all the foure grounds, yet takes but root in one: the <hi>hammar</hi> beats vpon all, but it makes not all pliable to Gods worke: the <hi>axe</hi> hewes at all, but it timbers but ſome for building, the reſt it hewes downe for firing: the <hi>fire</hi> burnes all, but only the the gold loſeth his droſſe: the <hi>light</hi> ſhines to all, but only they that haue eyes behold it: the <hi>ſalt</hi> ſeaſons all, but in ſome it cannot enter to the bone, and therefore they putrifie and rotte away: <hi>foode</hi> would feede all, but ſome want ſtomacks, appetite, and digeſtion: therfore they pine away with the beſt nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the <hi>goad</hi> prickles all, but ſome are hardned that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter, and therefore no maruell that the mercies and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of God ſhould worke no good effects in the wicked.</p>

Seuenthly, to make the finall vp-ſhotte of his bodie, <hi>he ſhall fal before his enemies, and his carkeis ſhal be without all burial, the foules of the ayre, and the beaſts of the field ſhall haue him for their pray, and none ſhall reſcue him:</hi> if the enemies ſpare him, God will ſmite him with the <hi>botch of Egypt, with the Emorods, with the ſcab, &amp; with the itch,</hi> euen worſe then he hath done Egypt, for he ſhall not be healed: neither will God be defectiue in his methode, for from theſe more ſenſible torments vpon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, he will proceede to greater iudgements vpon the ſoule, which though leaſt felt, yet more fearefull; <hi>madnes, blindnes, aſtonying of heart, with all their ill conſequents; to grope at noone day, to be oppreſſed, powled, and without all ſuccour:</hi> neither here ſhall the Lord reſt vpon bodie and ſoule, but ſtrike him in his neareſt friends, his wife, &amp;c. Neither may we maruel at this: for in nature wee ſee how ſome <hi>corne</hi> is <hi>ſowen,</hi> but neuer riſeth, ſome <hi>ſpringeth,</hi> and yet ſhortly <hi>withereth,</hi> ſome <hi>groweth</hi> vp to an eare, and yet then is <hi>ſtricken</hi> or blaſted; other at Gods good pleaſure commeth to <hi>ripeneſſe:</hi> ſome <hi>trees</hi> are <hi>planted,</hi> yet neuer take roote, ſome <hi>roote</hi> yet neuer bloſſome, ſome <hi>bloſſome,</hi> yet neuer bring forth fruit, &amp; others through Gods bleſſing, <hi>bring forth fruite in due ſeaſon:</hi> if God ſo deale with the plant and hearb of the field, why may he not deale in like manner with man, which is as wel in the hands of his creator, as the ſmalleſt creature vpon the face of the earth?</p>

                     <p>There be three kinds of Puritans, and he that prooues not one of them ſhall neuer be ſaued. Firſt, is the Papiſticall puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, that dare plead with God for his iuſtification; and this is a damnable puritan. The ſecond, is a ſchiſmaticall puritan, that rends himſelfe from euery Church that will not agree with his phantaſie; and this is likewiſe a wretched puritan. A third, is the Chriſtian Puritan, ſuch an one as I am ſure the word of God approoues of, and onely pronounceth them bleſſed that are pure in heart: and theſe are defended by the booke of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer, wherein we call vpon God that we might lead a godly, ſober, and pure life: and he that is not this puritan, ſhal neuer ſee God: and let them know, that the ſeruants of God are of the blood royal, to wit, Chriſt Ieſus, and therefore haue Dauids heroicall ſpirit; durſt meet them on the field, and ſhew as good courage for a good cauſe as the beſt of them. But the ſeruants of the Lord, his faithfull miniſters, haue told it to the Church, that her faithfull friends haue beene abuſed by many a Churle, vnto whom they haue ſtood as walls of defence, and therefore their affections are vp in armes againſt them. But the Church will find <hi>cakes, bottles of wine, ſheepe readie dreſſed, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of corne, cluſters of raiſins, and abundance of figs,</hi> to meet all that loue her, to giue them kind intertainement.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Vſe</hi> reprehenſion.

               <p>THe ſecond part of Gods holines,
<note place="margin">Iuſtice.</note> is his <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> contained in the conſequent part of the ſentence, and is diſtributed into two <hi>adiuncts; Power,</hi> and <hi>Order.</hi> Power, in that God will
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:21235:152"/>be ſure to iudge: and Order, in that he will take no haſtie courſes, whereby all ſhould be done in confuſion. Excellent is our God; for firſt beeing a God almightie, he is able to doe what he pleaſeth with his creature: but ſecondly obſerue his order, and euery one ſhall confeſſe that he is a God of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent wiſdome: for things done in good method, ſtoppe the mouthes of all. Two men that put on armour, and like bulls of Baſan, puſh the one at the other, are not diſcommended for their power and ſtrength; but that beeing men, they wanted wiſdome to vſe their ſtrength aright; and that is, that they kept no good order: and therefore ſuch execution of iuſtice as this, is condemned: ſo that if our gratious King had no more arguments but this one, in forbidding all Duells, it were ſufficient: for graunt the exerciſe, the power of iuſtice; yet where is this order and good method, that the Lord would haue obſerued of all his ſeruants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath vnfolded vnto vs in his <hi>Ethicks,</hi> fiue <hi>intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vertues,</hi> which if they concurre not in all our actions, they will prooue exceedingly defectiue. Firſt <hi>intelligence,</hi> which giues information of the cauſe, and the reaſons of it: ſecondly <hi>ſcience,</hi> which diſpoſeth of euery neceſſarie truth in thoſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſo that thereby he ſhall iudge his cauſe to be good or bad: for, <hi>vt intellectus habet ſe ad verum &amp; ad falſum, ſic voluntas ad bonum vel malum:</hi> the vnderſtanding goes before and iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of truth and falſhood, and the will follows after, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth good or euill: the third vertue, is <hi>ſapience,</hi> ſeeing how he may diduct and draw out of the truths of ſcience, other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie truths which could not appeare but by the diſcourſe of this third vertue: the fourth <hi>prudence,</hi> which is the fourth perfection of our actions, when we doe all the former in good and comely order: the fifth <hi>Art,</hi> the higheſt degree of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when I doe all nimbly and very skilfully in <hi>knowing,</hi> in <hi>iudging, diſcourſing,</hi> &amp; <hi>applying.</hi> Theſe men may haue the three firſt vertues, but they are altogether deſtitute of the two laſt: they may know that their cauſe is good, and that both of them hath reaſon to complaine of iniurie: for braue ſpirits can not reſt without mutuall prouocations: ſecondly, they may know
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:21235:153"/>that diſgrace of their perſons is their ſhame, and the loſſe of their good name (which they eſteem better then the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious oyntment that they inioy) to be ſuch an iniurie, that it can deſerue no leſſe then ſome kind of trial: and ſo in the third place, diſcourſe of it, and conclude that therefore they will haue iuſtice executed, that they may bee reuenged for their wrongs: but alas, when they come to apply all this their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer knowledge, they want prudence, and ſo leap ouer the liſts of iuſtice, and breaking good order, ſpoile the exerciſe of all artes. For firſt, they breake the rule of <hi>diuinitie,</hi> in ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God by murther: the rule of <hi>ethickes,</hi> for fortitude and manhood is abuſed: the rule of <hi>politickes,</hi> for the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth is iniured by loſſe of ſuch perſons as might haue been his pillars: the rule of <hi>nature</hi> complaines, that would haue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe preſerued in all his ſubiects. Indeed ſpecial nature, for the good of generall nature, will ſeeme to croſſe himſelfe: the fire will deſcend, and the water will aſcend, before they will ſuffer ſuch a ſtranger as vacuitie to poſſeſſe any place among them: So indeed nature would neuerbe offended, if they would ſhed their blood for their countrie: Nature will make the hand to offer it ſelfe to be cut off, before the head receiue the blowe: becauſe nature is wiſe in order, knowing that the head is to be preferred before any other member, becauſe it hath in it the greateſt part of life. The people can tell Dauid, <hi>thou art better then ten thouſand of vs;</hi> and therefore no matter if we be all cut off to ſaue thy life.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed is that kingdome, that is not onely powerfull in iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, but that keeps good order in the execution. Indeed many may ſay, I will reprooue thee; but alas, how few ſay, I will ſet thine offences in order before thee. Many lie in priſon for a <hi>ſic volo, ſic iubeo, ſtat pro ratione voluntas:</hi> authoritie vrged by violence of paſſion, ſpoyles all Magiſtrates. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaies, that the law ought to be like the <hi>primum ſenſorium,</hi> which is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; ſo the law muſt ſauour of no qualitie, but his owne; for then would it neuer iudge aright. And as the lawe is, ſo ought the Magiſtrate to be; voide of all his owne paſſions: let the law rule him, as he meanes to rule the people, and then ſhould all
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:21235:153"/>be done in good order; and we ſhould not heare theſe lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table complaints; I am in priſon, but I knowe not for what cauſe; and the Magiſtrate ſaies, I ſhall lie there vntil my bones rotte. For the mercies of God, let vs be mooued betimes, as well to ſet mens ſinnes in order, as vſe our power in reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of them, leſt the Lord come and handle vs moſt roughly, in the power of his iuſtice, for this moſt hainous offence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in diuiding iuſtice againſt it ſelfe. So then the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lets vs ſee, that the power of God is neuer without his wiſedome; but that the Lord workes in all things, <hi>intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſcienter, ſapienter, prudenter, artificiosè;</hi> plainly, truely, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, prudently, and skilfully.</p>
               <p>The power of Gods iuſtice is laid downe in theſe words, <hi>I will reprooue thee:</hi> firſt, the cauſe, <hi>I, the Lord,</hi> which in the firſt verſe ſtyled my ſelfe, the <hi>God of Gods, euen the Lord from heauen;</hi> in compariſon aboue all, and in dominion ouer all, without compariſon: therefore a mightie iuſtice that hath ſo great a cauſe. Secondly, from the <hi>ſpecies</hi> or kind of it, <hi>a reproofe;</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vindicatiue, and reuenging iuſtice, ſtronger then remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratiue or rewarding iuſtice; for here appeares <hi>ira, furor, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candeſcentia;</hi> anger, a diſpleaſure of ſhort continuance; furie, a ſhort madneſſe; the third an inueterate hatred, that alwaies ſmoakes againſt ſinne, that kindles hote coales, <hi>hinc ira ex can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,</hi> fierineſſe full of brightneſſe. Thirdly, the obiect <hi>(thee;)</hi> the ſinne and the perſon, I am out of loue with both: and therefore will I diſcouer thy ſinne, which I know thou aboue all men mayeſt not endure to heare of. Secondly, what thou thy ſelfe art both in deceiuing and beeing deceiued, ſhal plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be knowne: therefore moſt powerfull iuſtice, whoſe cauſe is <hi>Iehouah;</hi> nature, <hi>vengeance;</hi> obiect, the moſt <hi>ſecret ſinne,</hi> and moſt <hi>deceitfull perſon,</hi> free from all the iudgement ſeats of men.</p>

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:21235:154"/>an vnpeaceable houſe in <hi>Belſhazzars</hi> ſoule: what a iolly fellow was he vntill this came into his eye? <hi>the time of Gods ſilence hee regarded not;</hi> neither to his father, how God gaue him a <hi>king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, maieſtie, honour, and glorie, at which all nations trembled, and feared before him: he ſmote and put to death whom he would; ſet vp and put downe whom he would:</hi> neither to himſelfe, miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying what was done vnto his father, both in iuſtice and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, but abuſed Gods veſſels, with his <hi>Princes, wiues, concubines; praiſed the gods of gold, ſiluer, of braſſe, yron, wood, and ſtone; which neither ſee, heare, nor vnderſtand:</hi> but the God in whoſe hand his breath was, and all his wayes, him would he not glorifie: therefore now ſee his Iudge, and tell mee if the power of his iuſtice make him not afraid. Hence it is plaine, that wicked men ſcant God in his mercies, as a niggard, or pinching giuer; when in their ſinnes they are both large and bold, and thinke Gods armes bound vp in a cloth; yet let them knowe, that this <hi>(I, will reprooue)</hi> will prooue no ſmall matter: for the <hi>very weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God, is ſtronger then any thing in man,</hi> 1. Cor. 1. In man wee count that weaknes, which his little finger hardly can touch: now Gods little finger will make all ſmart. The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians of Egypt</hi> in the plague of lice, confeſſe it was Gods fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, becauſe that brought mightie things to paſſe: <hi>Iobs afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> loſſe of <hi>goods, cattell, children;</hi> the deuill makes it but the touch of Gods finger, and yet this ſpent all. Mans breath but a weake thing, Iſa. 40.17. yet the breath of the Lord, Pſal. 18.8. ſmoake went out of his noſtrhills, and a conſuming fire out of his mouth; coales were kindled thereat: great is the power of his very noſtrhills, and mightie is the verie weakenes, and infirmitie of his wrath: if his weakenes be this, what is his ſtrength, compared to a Gyant, or Lyon; to a Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, of all men the greateſt; to a Lyon, of all beaſts the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt? If ſo mightie when he toucheth but with his finger, how terrible if he ſtrike with his arme? but what will he be when he comes armed with his ſword, &amp; his bow bent? if we be far off, his arrowe ſhall reach vs; if neere, his ſword ſhall ſtrike vs. But alas, what ſhall be done, when he ſhall come with whole armies of creatures againſt vs; <hi>fire, haile, thunder:</hi> ſo if the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:21235:154"/>ſword finde vs not, the thunder ſhall meet with vs; if the haile make not an end, the fire ſhall conſume vs; if the fire can not burne, then his mallet ſhall bruiſe vs. Furthermore, he hath his charets, <hi>euen a thouſand charets in the whirl-wind,</hi> and his <hi>pillars of fire</hi> to terrifie vs; yea, <hi>his thouſand and tenne thouſand of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> to make a ſpoile of all at his becke. Therefore we ſhall be ſooner wearie of ſuffering, then he of afflicting; of flying, then he of following.

The <hi>wrath of a king is the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of death:</hi> what is then the wrath of the king of kings? if one man treſpas againſt another, there may a third be found to make vp the matter; <hi>but if one ſinne againſt God,</hi> ſaith old Eli to his ſonnes, <hi>who ſhal plead for him?</hi> Therfore do no more ſo ye ſonnes of men, tremble and ſin not; <hi>examine your owne hearts, and be ſtill; ſerue the Lord in feare, and reioyce in trembling: kiſſe the ſonne, leaſt he be angry, and ye periſh in the way: when his wrath ſhall ſuddenly burne, bleſſed are all that truſt in him.</hi> Neither is this all Gods reproouing: for this is but the paine of ſenſe; but they alſo ſhall haue a more fearefull plague, the plague of plagues, and the onely thing that ſhall make them miſerable; and that the learned haue called, the puniſhment of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as though it were all, and gaue the whole denomination: and that is Gods fare-well vnto his creature: Oh my creature, I made thee in my owne image; but thou haſt <hi>found out many inuentions:</hi> therefore muſt I thy <hi>life, and length of dayes;</hi> the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of liuing waters,</hi> he <hi>in whome thou liues, mooues, and haſt thy beeing,</hi> bid thee be gone: I muſt neuer looke on thee more, as I haue done: thy louing wife ſhall ſay, farewell my husband: thy children, friends, and all thy pleaſures, in which thou haſt ſong a long <hi>loath to depart,</hi> yet muſt yee needes depart: or if you goe together to hell, yet ſhall it but augement thy ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,

Oh would to God that I had neuer been! <hi>you that paſſe by, will you take no pity on me?</hi> Oh God, I was thy child, and the deuill whippes mee, and hell fire ſcorcheth mee; yet if thou wouldeſt but looke vpon me, how would that refreſh mee? Well, that I lie not, ſee both theſe put together: for I aſſure you, that hell fire is no painted fire; for the want of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſhall be no dreame, or idle obliuion of the departure of a kind friend; but the verie ſting of conſcience, and the worme that ſhall neuer leaue gnawing. See both puniſhment of ſenſe, and the damned: 2. Theſſ. 1.9. <hi>Which ſhall be puniſhed with euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting perdition from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glorie of his power.</hi> And that the Lord will doe all this, it is plaine, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. 12. laſt.

Alſo it is more forcibly felt of the creature, then Gods remuncratiue iuſtice; becauſe this ſtrikes at the verie heart, touches his verie conſcience, with the extremitie of horror and feare, and leaues neither bodie nor ſoule without moſt exquiſite torments, ſuch as were neuer inuented of men: the <hi>racke in England,</hi> the <hi>Strappado in Spaine,</hi> nor any torture inuented by the wit of man, ſhall euer come neere this; no not the ſtrange torments of Tyrants.

And therefore Chriſtians that are ſo much caſt downe, at the threatnings of the Lord, are with the wicked but fooles and faint hearted perſons: nay, more then this, let the hand of the Lord light vpon their fellow-compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and that ſhall be no prognoſtication to them.

One calls the excommunication of <hi>Paulus quintus</hi> againſt the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, dirum carmen;</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaies of <hi>Prudentius,</hi> when he appoints certaine holy-daies in hell, <hi>Paenarum celebres, ſub ſtyge feriae.</hi> Euen ſo the world deales with God: his threatning are but idle Tragedies, and the puniſhments in hell may haue their holy-daies, wherein men may take their recreations. So that now God ſhall be as well beholding to <hi>ieſting Lucian,</hi> or any inuenter of fables, or tragedies of hell, to make one old woman weepe, or tremble, as to his owne Prophets, or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: but let them be aſſured, that hell is no painted fire, for they ſhall finde that God hath fire and ſagot, ſword and bow, ſpeare and yron rods, to daſh in pieces euery one, although as

Euen as in a darke night, one ſtarre breaking out of a thicke cloud, deliuereth a farre more ſplendent and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous light, then if it ſhone with many in a cleare euening: ſo this iuſtice hath the more grace and beautie from the Lord in the wicked, inſomuch as almoſt all other planets had a long time beene eclipſed, or quite fallen out of their <hi>ſpheres,</hi> to the great diſcomfort of all ſuch as trauailed with the wicked (though not in their waies) yet in the ſelfe ſame night, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied themſelues at the lamps of Gods word, beeing carefull to vphold the ſocietie of mankind by learning and inſtruction. Ionah the Prophet, was content to enter into the citie a daies iourney, and preached, and ſo continued walking with the men in the citie, vntill they put on ſackcloth, faſted, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themſelues: this might exceedingly haue comforted Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah, to ſee ſo chearefull and comfortable a light breake forth as repentance: but alas Ionah is diſpleaſed, and that exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he ſhould prognoſticate of a flaming fire from heauen within fourtie daies to deſtroy Nineueh, and yet nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare according to his word; this made him angrie, impudent with God: now againe to defend his fleeing into Tarſhiſh, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Lord had appeared vnto him in the fearefull tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, prepared a fiſh, heard his prayer, brought him to drie land; yet now becauſe God will not come from heauen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his word, he wiſheth that he might die, and that God would ſhew his iuſtice on him. One would haue thought Ionah might haue bin well cooled in the ſea, from raging ſo hotly againſt God. Well <hi>Ionah,</hi> get thee vnder the Lords gourd, <hi>that it may be a ſhadow for thy head,</hi> and deliuer thee
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:21235:157"/>from thy griefe, and make thee exceeding glad; and expect patiently, and doubt not but thy words ſhall come to paſſe. For firſt, thou propheſied to Iſrael a long time, and they haue profited nothing; this could not but vexe thee exceedingly: now I haue but ſent <hi>thee three daies into the citie of Nineueh, the chiefe citie of the Aſſyrians,</hi> all of them are the heathen, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard tell of my name, without my Chriſt, <hi>aliens from the common-wealth of Iſrael, ſtrangers from the couenants of promiſe, and had no hope, and were without God in the world:</hi> yet thou ſees what a wonderfull effect it hath wrought in Nineueh; the King is off his throne, hath laide his robe from him, couered himſelfe with ſackcloth, and ſits in the aſhes: further, he makes proclamation for a generall faſt of man and beaſt, all to crie mightily vnto God; turne from their wickednes with this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, that the Lord would repent &amp; turne from his fierce wrath, that ſo they might not periſh: Oh happie Ionah, that it pleaſed God to let thee ſee this glorious worke of thy mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie: ſurely thou may well be glad, vnder the gourd to ſing Pſalmes vnto the Lord for ſuch a deliuerance: and if the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in heauen be ſo ioyfull for one ſinner, how mighteſt thou triumph for ſuch a multitude, as the whole citie of Niniueh, wherein were <hi>ſixeſcore thouſandinfants, that could not diſcerne betwixt the right hand, or the left:</hi> Or if thou had been mooued toward thine owne countri-men, haue made as much haſt, as the woman of Samaria did vnto her neighbours, to tell them ſhe had found the Meſſias: ſo might thou haue done vnto Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael: O Iſrael, I pray you runne with me to Nineuch, and ſee the ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt wonder that euer was done; a whole city for three dayes preaching, <hi>repenting in ſackcloth and aſhes.</hi> But alas Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah, thou art of an other temper; thou haſt made thee a booth, and art ſet vnder the ſhadow of it, to ſee what may be done to the city: Alas, wouldſt thou with <hi>Nero,</hi> laugh to ſee all the city on fire? haſt thou neuer a ſparke of old father <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpirit in thee? this citie is farre better then <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> &amp; yet thou knoweſt how vehemently Abraham pleaded for them.

Moreouer. God forbid, that I ſhould ſinne againſt the Lord, and ceaſe praying for you; but I will ſhew you the good &amp; right way: Feare the Lord, ſerue him in the truth with all your hearts, &amp; conſider how great things he hath done for you: but if ye doe wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ye ſhall periſh, both yee and your king.</hi> Surely Ionah, if this had beene thy concluſion, thou ſhouldſt haue ſeene the Lord ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue ſatisfied thy prophecy: for this was but a formall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, and therefore fortie yeares after, the Lord deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, according to thy word: therefore Ionah, obſerue, that God hath as well prepared a worme to ſmite thy gourd, and make it wither by the ſunne, as hee made it growe by the ſame; and by the ſame ſunne, and a feruent Eaſt-wind, make thee faint, and wiſh to die: neither haſt thou any cauſe to bee angry, for thou neuer labouredſt for theſe mercies; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what haſt thou to doe, to grieue at my mercies vnto Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neueh? I bad thee reprooue them, and ſurely, what I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſhall be done: for Nineueh ſhall be reprooued. And therefore all faithfull labourers of the Lord, ſticke to your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and let the Lord bleſſe and curſe, when it ſhall pleaſe him.</p>

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that iuſtice may ſtand in his proportion; if the wicked haue the beſt, where the beſt is not; and the iuſt haue the worſt where the worſt is not; then ſhal the wicked to anſwer iuſtice, haue the worſt where the beſt is not; nay, no good thing at all: and the iuſt haue againe the beſt, where the worſt is not; nay, no miſery at all, but perfect happineſſe. Hence naturall men haue dreamed of the <hi>Elyſian fields,</hi> and of the fire of hell.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Vſe reprehenſion.</hi> Firſt, confutation of the wicked, that thinke the Lord is all leade, heauie footed to iudgement; and that his hands ſhall alway be in a clout: or if he pull them out, he is ſo tender of them, that hee may not endure to lay them vpon their hard hearts, leaſt by the blow, he ſhould complaine of the ſtiffe reſiſtance of the ſtroke. Well, they ſhall knowe, that he hath hands of braſſe, and rods of yron in them, to cruſh them in peices. Secondly, correction of the godly, that think the Lord is too tender ouer the wicked: Ionah was too blame in this, therefore lay it aſide: for it is Gods truth, that he will reprooue with ſmall tendernes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Vſe inſtruction.</hi> Firſt, an admonition of the wicked, that they beware: for the arrowes of the Lord flie among them. If a ſtrong archer miſſing his aime, let his arrow flie among them that are beholding his ſhooting, will he not crie aloud, looke to your ſelues? and the cryer of aime ſhout with a mighty voice, to the right hand or to the left, take heede the arrow is among you: But alas, the people are ſo amazed, that they may as wel runne vnder it, as eſcape it, ſo that all are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but it lights but vpon the pate of one of them, and he falls
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:21235:158"/>to the ground wounded, and yeelds vp the ghoſt; all the reſt quake, and tremble at the ſight, and are ſpeechleſſe: So the Lord is daily ſhooting forth his arrowes, he neuer miſſeth his aime; the watchmen of the citie tell the people, the arrowe of God is among them, and for all this no man is afraid; it ſtrikes downe ſome of the ſtouteſt of them: but alas, all is giuen to ſome ſurfet or weakeneſſe in the man, which they finding themſelues free from, thinke it is impoſſible for them to die as he did, becauſe they haue not his diſeaſe; as though there were no more diſeaſes to cut off life, then that one. If a meſſenger knocke at the doore, and anſwer be giuen him preſently, hee is gone without delay: ſo beloued, Gods plagues would not ſtill rage at our doores, if we gaue God his anſwer; yet ſtill the Lord rings the bel at our doore.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a direction to the godly, to <hi>watch continually,</hi> that ſo they may eſcape the iudgements of the Lord, and mourne for his iudgements vpon others; for theſe <hi>April dewes, will bring forth in them the May flowers of Gods ſpirit:</hi> and in weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſtil reſpect our ſelues more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other: for that alone makes God carie <hi>handkerchifes to wipe away our teares:</hi> and this ſowing in teares, will bring vs a ſpeedie harueſt: and when the rod is vpon others, let vs take it to our ſelues: for is it not better to take the rod into our owne hands, and beate our ſelues gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then the Lord, who is a conſuming fire, ſhould waſt vs with it? Bones out of ioynt, the longer they goe, they prooue more painfull, betimes they are ſet more eaſily: therefore let vs betimes ſet our ſelues in the waies of the Lord, leaſt he rebuke vs ſharply. We phyſicke, purge, ſweate, and all for the bodie: can we indure nothing for the ſoule? the <hi>vomite of the ſoule is the greife of repentance:</hi> and tell me I pray you, who euer repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him of repentant ſorrow? In theſe reproofes we are worſe afraid then hurt: riſing out of a ſoft bed is exceeding tedious to a ſluggard; yet our vp, doth not dare vs at all: ſo is the awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king from the ſleepe of ſinne, and ſlumbering in the reliques of ſinne, which ſtill haue dwelling in the beſt of vs. To ſee a ſouldier wounded is no newes, but to goe with it, is deſperate follie: ſo our ſighting in this world, is no newes if it bring
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:21235:159"/>knocks and maimes vnto vs: yet to let them goe and ranckle, and feſter, is forlorne negligence; therefore let this direction take his impreſſion in our ſoules, that we may make excellent vſe of all Gods reproofes.</p>

But it may be obiected, that nothing can be hated, but that which is euill:
<note place="margin">The obiect of Gods hatred.</note> now the perſons of wicked men are good, the ſinne is onely euill, therefore onely hated. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Euill is conſidered two wayes; Firſt, in the abſtract, as beeing not conſidered with the ſubiect in which it is; and ſo it is equally hated of God euery where. Secondly, in the concrete, when the euill and the ſubiect are put together: euill abſolutely taken, and an euill man are diuers conſiderations; the ſame cauſe of hatred in both, but not the ſame manner: for a godly man is of an other condition; ſeeing ſinne in him, is but a tyrant, and he is none
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:21235:159"/>of his lawfull ſubiects, and therefore though ſinne fights to ſubdue him vnto his kingdome, yet the ſpirit of God reſiſts and will be the ruler. Therefore as the loue of the ſubiects ſtand toward their king, ſo doth the king loue them. Now the loue of ſinne and wicked men is naturall, and ſo is the loue of God and his children ſpiritually naturall: and therefore muſt he needes loue his owne ſubiects, and hate all his enemies: for if an enemie ſhould captiuate a loyall ſubiect, the king would preſently require him againe, when he is content to let his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies haue their owne libertie ouer their owne ſlaues. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the children of God, loſe not the name of righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, becauſe they ſinne: for it is rather ſinne in themſelues, then themſelues that offend God: Rom. 7.

Indeede to behold the light, is a comfotable thing, but for ſore eyes it is verie trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome: and therefore thoſe that doe euill, hate the light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their works are euill: and ſo the Lord muſt needs araigne them euen in the cleare ſunne-ſhine, to the view of all men, euen of their verie conſciences, Ioh. 3.</p>

The clouds in the aire can not alwaies ſhade the ſunne from the eyes of the world, nor the darkneſſe of the night alwaies ſhut vp the morning brightnes: ſo ſhall not ſinne alwaies fill the world with his myſts and clouds, and alwaies ſhut vp the day of the Lords appearance to iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the Lord will breake the heauens, and make the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of his Sonne appeare, at which <hi>heauen and earth ſhall flee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;</hi> and then ſhall the <hi>thoughts of all hearts be made manifeſt.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Vſe</hi> reprehenſion: firſt, confutation of the wicked, that make ſo much of their ſinnes, that are not aſhamed to boaſt of them.

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, correction to the godly, that are ſo meale-mouthed at ſinne, that haue not a word to ſay for the Lord of hoſts. We are too often in the extreames; when God is ſilent, we would be ſpeaking; and when the Lord is ſpeaking, we would be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: eſpecially Miniſters, that dare not ſpeake when the Lord hath bidden them ſpeake boldly, and not feare the faces of the proudeſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Vſe</hi> inſtruction. Firſt, an admonition to the wicked, to beware of ſinning: know they not, that euery time they ſinne, they hold vp their hands to heauen to pray vnto God for

Secondly, a direction to Gods children, to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the bitternes of their ſinnes: Exod. 15. for ſinnes may be compared to the <hi>waters of Marah;</hi> and Gods reproofe to the <hi>bitterneſſe of thoſe waters:</hi> and Iſraels murmuring may ſet forth the <hi>diſcontedneſſe of the ſoule, in taſting of thoſe waters:</hi> the crie of the people, <hi>what ſhall we drinke?</hi> to ſet forth the thirſtie deſire of the ſoule to be ſatisfied with ſome ſweet water.

Suppoſe that a malefactor were condemned to die, and the day of his execution were at hand, how would this affect him in his ſoule? how would he labour to eſcape it; trie all his friends, his goods, wife, children, kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes, &amp; the deareſt of his acquaintance? his wealth can ſerue him no better but to prouide for him while he liueth, ſee him honourably buried when he is dead: his wife and children and the reſt, tell him they will weepe for him; all theſe are but cold comforts to the man that muſt die: But if one ſhould ſtep out and ſay, my life for yours, if that will free you: hee offers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the king, the king accepts of him, deliuers the pardon, brings it to the malefactor: now he is at eaſe, and hardly can a man imagine the greatneſſe of his ioy: ſurely, if that bee true that a man may die laughing, hee might as ſoone looſe his life in this paſſion of ioy, as he might haue done in the paſſion of his ſorrow. Euen the ſelfe ſame cauſe is paralelled in a man on his death-bed; I am reprooued of the Lord, and adiudged to
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:21235:161"/>eternall death for my ſinnes: alas, how ſhall I eſcape? my goods are nothing vnto thee, O Lord, thou wilt not take them for the redemption of my ſoule: my wife, and children, and good friends ſtanding about my bed, cut me at the very heart: no worldly comfort can refreſh my ſoule: Oh my God, take thy Chriſt for the redemption of my ſoule, he is able to ſtand betwixt thy wrath and my ſinne; in him lift <hi>vpon me the light of thy countenance:</hi> for therein ſtands my exceeding ioy, farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the <hi>increaſe of oyle, corne, wine, or any worldly thing.</hi>

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:21235:162"/>of hypocriſie. Secondly, correction of the godly, that make not a diſtinction of their loue, betwixt formall profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and true hearted Chriſtians: Dauid is onely a companion of all them that feare the Lord, and are approoued of God; but for the wicked and hypocrits that wil not confeſſe that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent preſence of the Lord as he doth, Pſal. 139. <hi>He hates them earneſtly with an vnfained hatred, as though they were alſo his vtter enemies.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Vſe inſtruction.</hi> Firſt, admonition of the wicked, that they bee better aduiſed of their preſumptions: for ſurely they are ſarre out of Gods loue: and therefore that they may a little try themſelues, I will helpe them a little to examine their eſtates. Luk. 12.1. take heed to your ſelues of the leauen of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, which is hypocriſic: for there is nothing couered, that ſhal not be reuealed; neither hid, that ſhall not bee knowne. The Scripture laies downe plainely what hypocrites are, and what they are not: both of them are laid together, Prou. 30.12. firſt what they are, to wit, a <hi>generation</hi> for multitude, <hi>pure for</hi> qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, in <hi>their owne conceit</hi> for the beſt ground of all their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: a generation, borne of themſelues; pure in outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, to deceiue the world; and in their owne conceit, to deceiue themſelues. Let vs therefore ſee their building, that they raiſe out of their owne conceit: Maskes once ſerued men to play and ſport in ieſt, but now they are vſed in good earneſt; and the hypocrite is the moſt excellent at this game: theſe men would be kings, haue all at command, and ſcorne to abaſe themſelues in compariſon with any: but let them know, that as at the cheſt play the king commands all, vntill the mate be giuen without redreſſe, and then he is but like the reſt: ſo when death ſhall checke theſe kingly hypocrits, it ſhal be knowne that they are no better then the common ſort of people, that muſt euerie mothers ſonne of them to hell. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the <hi>Cupreſſe tree,</hi> is ſtraight and tall; in colour freſh and greene; yet on the ſame no holſome fruite doth growe, which is fit for nouriſhment: ſo that by the taſt we may eſpie the goodnes of the tree: therefore ſaith Chriſt, by their fruit yee ſhall know them. In <hi>Phaenicia</hi> the people raiſed a figure on hie,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:21235:163"/>that all men might obſerue it, and on the top painted a <hi>Serpent</hi> in a circle, to ſhewe that in the world there is no greater arte, then man to know himſelfe in euerie part. Let vs then a little enter this conſideration, and ſee what grounds hee laies of theſe his conceits.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he conſiders <hi>his perfections,</hi> as the perfections of <hi>nature;</hi> a nimble <hi>wit,</hi> good <hi>memorie,</hi> full of <hi>ciuilitie,</hi> and faire <hi>conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Secondly, beeing within the bounds of Gods church, he may obtaine certaine <hi>graces of Gods ſpirit:</hi> as firſt, from the <hi>word</hi> in generall, <hi>vnderſtanding, conſent</hi> to the truth, <hi>ſubmiſſion, affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, delight</hi> in the meſſengers, and to be a <hi>companion</hi> with the Saints and all frequenters of Gods church. For the <hi>law,</hi> he may <hi>ſee</hi> his <hi>ſinnes,</hi> the <hi>wrath</hi> of God due for them, <hi>horror</hi> of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>reluctation</hi> againſt ſinne, <hi>ſorrow,</hi> and a certaine <hi>change,</hi> Mat. 12.43. 2. Pet. 2.20. Mar. 6.20. For the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> knowledge of the couenant, that God is faithfull, that Chriſts merits are of infinite value; and teares may flow from his eyes, either in hearing or reading the paſſion of our Sauiour Chriſt. Degrees of his perfections, Heb. 6. 1, <hi>illumination:</hi> 2. <hi>participation</hi> of the heauenly gift, holy Ghoſt, Gods word, and of the powers to come: theſe are his perfections.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs ſee what reaſons may perſwade him to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. Firſt, when he lookes vpon himſelfe, hee ſees his heart to bee quiet within him, and not boyle with the fowle and vglie ſinnes of the world. Secondly, he ſees his eſtate to be verie good in the world, and full of proſperitie. Thirdly, he thinkes his profeſſion is with the beſt; he is as good a church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as any other. Againe, he lookes vp vnto God, and is verie lauiſh of Gods mercie; he cares not to ſet it vpon the tenters, and makes it riſe as high as the mountaines: but for his iuſtice, he ſcants that, and makes it like a mole-hill. When he thinks of the deuill, he finds himſelfe nothing at all to bee troubled with him: with <hi>a voide Sathan,</hi> he can ſcare him from him at any time: when he ſets himſelfe vpon the ſtage with other men, he ſees how the wicked cannot come neere him; and yet they haue often a faire life, &amp; an eaſie death; and therefore ſhal it be farre better with him: And for preciſe perſons, he cannot
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:21235:163"/>tell what to ſay of them; ſometime they are too proud for his companie; another time they are too ful of hypocriſie, he dares not truſt them; ſometimes they are a companie of fooles, and therefore he will not runne gadding about with fooles; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time men full of melancholy and ſadnes, fit for no ſocietie; or els ſingular fellowes, that thinke none ſo good as themſelues; or els will haue a life by themſelues: and therefore they will not liue in ſocietie with them: but alas, they are the men of pride, that thinke that God dwells with them alone. <hi>Buce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalus</hi> was then in cheifeſt pride, when rich armor was ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his backe, and none might ride him but <hi>Alexander:</hi> ſo theſe hypocrites beeing in honour in the world, will ſuffer none to accompanie with them, but God himſelfe; for in compariſon, he excludes all. And furely queſtion with him of his eſtate, and for the moſt you ſhall finde them verie reſolute, like vnto the <hi>Gyant of Gath;</hi> they haue fingers and thumbes enough to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend mercie. Aske them, <hi>meane you to be ſaued?</hi> they anſwer reſolutly, God forbid they ſhould euer think otherwiſe: when alas poore Chriſtians, lie wraſtling with many a temptation. Aske them againe, <hi>doe you beleeue?</hi> beleeue! he that would not beleeue God, were a wretch indeede. Aske him in the third place, <hi>haue you any doubtings with your faith?</hi> doubtings! why ſhould I doubt? the Lord is moſt certen in his promiſes: when in both theſe, the child of God is much perplexed. Aske him in the laſt place, <hi>when did you beleeue?</hi> ſurely, euer ſince I was borne: yet alas, many a good ſeruant of God will ſay, once I was as blacke as a coale in ſinne, but it hath pleaſed God to put on me a whiter garment: I know the verie day when hell did gape vpon me, and at ſuch a ſermon it pleaſed God to ſtrike me to the ground, and raiſe me vp againe in his mercie: or at leaſt, they that haue beene ſanctified from their mothers wombe, will crie and ſay, <hi>Oh wretched men that we are, who ſhall deliuer vs from this bodie of death?</hi> This fight of the members, and of the ſpirit, is an excellent perſwaſion of true grace; but alas, theſe wretches, when in the time of neceſſitie, they come to make vſe of their faith; what doe they I pray you? truly they are become like <hi>Adonibezek,</hi> they haue loſt all their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:21235:164"/>and muſt famiſh for want of laying hold of their meate; ſo that all their beautie periſheth. For beloued, as greene fruits and flowers doe ripen by the ſunne, whoſe rayes bring forth their budds, and their ſmells; ſo by the ſonne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes alone, muſt all the flowers of Gods garden mend their ſmells and ſauours. And therefore let vs proceede to ſee what they are not, for want of this ſunne; and that conſiſts in the ſecond part of the verſe, <hi>yet they are not waſhed from their fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>Labyrinth</hi> is framed with ſuch art, that the entrance is both plaine and wide; but beeing entred, you ſhall finde ſuch turnings, that you can not come out againe without your guide: ſo this conceit of puritie, hath made ſuch a large en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the hearts of hypocrites, that they can not be brought out of their turnings without the guide of Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Therefore let vs view theſe two threeds, that are here laid downe to helpe vs. Firſt, they <hi>are not waſhed:</hi> ſecondly, they <hi>are in their filthines. Ianus</hi> had two faces; and in the one hand he had a key, in the other the ſunne: from <hi>Ianus</hi> comes Ianuarie, that lookes at both parts of the yeare: his two faces makes him looke forward and backward: by his key, he is able to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the day, and ſhut in the night: by the ſunne in the hand, he is able to diſcouer all things. Formalitie in religion may be expreſſed in <hi>Ianus,</hi> vntill we come to the key and the ſunne: the hypocrites can looke at both parts of the yeare, winter and ſommer; but they will haue their backe vpon winter, and their face vpon ſommer: for when winter comes againe, and lookes them in the face, they hide their heads, and will not be ſeene: like vnto <hi>ſnailes,</hi> that are abroad while the dew is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, but creepe into their houſes when they finde the dew to be dried vp by the ſunne. Againe, they haue two faces, they can looke backward and forward, ſerue all times, pleaſe all perſons, and keepe themſelues out of daunger: but when we come vnto the key, whereby heauen is opened, and ſhut in, they haue none at all: they loſt their key of righteouſnes in Adam, and as yet they haue it not reſtored in Chriſt, who <hi>alone hath the keyes of Dauid, which openeth and no man ſhutteth, which
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:21235:164"/>ſhutteth and no man openeth.</hi> And for the ſunne in the other hand, they haue none: for how can they hold out the Sonne of righteouſnes, that neuer had him in their hearts by faith? they ſhine indeede, but it is like vnto a <hi>blazing ſtarre,</hi> which ſeemes to mooue as though it came from a true ſtarre indeede, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las it is in the fall, and preſently comes to the earth; and then what is it but a lumpe of very crude matter, and as cold as a ſtone: or like <hi>glow-wormes,</hi> which in the night time, make a ſhew of fire, but when a man takes them in his hands and brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them, they are nothing but a deale of crude, rough, blacke blood. So theſe hypocrites, they come from heauen like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by the taile of the deuill, and fall to the ground, and then their glorie appeares no more: they were alwaies cold at the heart, and therefore their ſhining vaniſheth, when the true Sonne of righteouſnes appeareth to trie them. Let vs then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the hypocrite, and wee ſhall finde, (that although his ſword, and all the weapons of his profeſſion be ouerſpread with honie,) yet a bee ſhall ſting him at the laſt, and make him know, that all that honie was none of his owne, but that hee had ſtollen it from Gods bees; and therefore beeing but the waſpe, muſt be caſt out of Gods hiue. The <hi>fiſher</hi> oftentimes when he bragges of ſtore of fiſhes, puls vp a <hi>ſcorpion</hi> in his net, which becomes his death: ſo theſe hypocrites, they fiſh for heauen, but the ſcorpion is alreadie in their boſomes which will ſting them to death: they hatch <hi>cockatrice</hi> egges: whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer commeth from them, is poyſon and death: they weaue the ſpiders webbe, all their religion comes to no proofe: he that <hi>eateth of their egges dieth, and that which is troad vpon, breaketh out into a ſerpent.</hi> For it is impoſſible that all mankind, being the ſeed of coruption; and ſecondly, the moſt of them, the ſeed of the ſerpent, ſhould bring forth any other thing but corruption, and young ſerpents. And therefore hypocrits, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maning in their former eſtate, muſt needs be farre from God, and all true holineſſe. They are not waſhed, therefore not in Chriſt. Secondly, they are in their filthineſſe; therefore in themſelues. Not in Chriſt, becauſe they know not the father, by the Son, through the holy Ghoſt. They are moſt buſie with
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:21235:165"/>the father; but alas, for Chriſt, and the ſpirit, they caſt them both off. God will haue mercie, and God forbid, that any man ſhould think that God meant to damne his creature: but alas, they are ſilent of his iuſtice; &amp; Chriſt is little in their mouthes, for the ſatisfaction of Gods iuſtice, and the onely foundation of Gods mercie to come vnto them: &amp; the ſpirit is farre eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from them, as appeares by their ſanctification. But let them know, that Gods ſaithfull ones make an other kinde of demonſtration, then to beginne with the father firſt: Rom. 8.1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt;</hi> but how ſhall that be knowne? ſurely, by that which followeth; <hi>which walke not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit:</hi> but how ſhall this be knowne? why looke into the Gal. 5.19. to v. 24.</p>
                  <p>That this may the better appeare, let vs ſee how hypocrites pull downe the old building, and reare vp the new: for vntill that be gone, there is no hope of a better. That they would haue the old building ſtand, it ſhall euidently appeare in the 7. of the Romans: firſt, if you looke vnto their <hi>mariage,</hi> you ſhal ſee they will ſticke to their old husband the lawe; yet will they haue Chriſt too, and therfore commit adulterie; for God will but permit them one husband: therefore either Law or Goſpel; doing, or beleeuing; Chriſt, or Moſes: both can not ſtand together to make vs the ſpouſe of Chriſt. Secondly, let vs ſee their <hi>ſeruice and obedience,</hi> that they yeild vnto their husbands. It is not in the newneſſe of the ſpirit, but in the old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the letter: ſurely an hypocrite is all in the letter, no iot of inward ſanctification is in him: but Law and Goſpel ſpeaks vnto him as a deafe man: and ſo for power, both of them are but dead and dumbe vnto him. Thirdly, <hi>they loue no innouati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> they would haue the old ordination to ſtand, to doe, and liue; but now to be ſlaine by the law, and to haue ſinne made ſinne indeede, and haue their hearts euen bleede to the death by it, that can not be indured: for men naturally loue life bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then death: but now it is come to paſſe by our fall, that except the Law kill, it can not ſaue. Fourthly, they <hi>haue no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corning ſpirit,</hi> to ſee how the Law is ſpirituall, and they carnal, fold vnder ſinne: for they alwaies allow that which they doe;
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:21235:165"/>their will and doing goe together, their hatred is not their doing: when Paul ſaith, hee wills one thing by Gods good ſpirit, and by his fleſh doth the cleane contrarie; hee hateth ſinne by the ſpirit, and yet often is made to doe it by his owne corruption: thus doth hee iuſtifie the lawe, and and makes it good and ſubſtantiall, but himſelfe euill and naught: when hypocrites take the law to make them good, for they are iuſtifiers of themſelues. Paul by this meanes came to ſee, that it was not he the newe man, that did theſe things, but ſinne that dwelt in him; and therefore hee onely iuſtifies not Gods law to condemne himſelfe, but alſo he makes a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous confeſſion, that all power may be taken from himſelfe, and aſcribed vnto the holy Ghoſt, for his ſanctification: for I <hi>know, that in me,</hi> ſetting the ſpirit aſide, and therefore I meane in my fleſh and corruption, <hi>dwelleth no good thing: for to will is preſent with me,</hi> but I find no meanes to performe that which is good. And ſurely reaſons of this I haue many. Firſt, the ſtrength of my corruption: ſecondly, it is yoked with me, and therefore beeing the ſtronger, drawes me vnto euill: thirdly, I am a double perſon, or a double man, the inner and outward man, which is ſo rebellious, that I neuer liue at peace with my ſelfe: fourthly, theſe two haue their lawes, and the outward man doth often captiuate me, and make me a ſlaue vnto ſinne: and I am ſo ſore oppreſſed, that I muſt needs cry out, <hi>O wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man that I am, who ſhall deliuer me from this bodie of death?</hi> yet thanks be to God, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, that my mind is ſo good vnto God, and his lawe, though my fleſh will not as yet ſhake hands with ſin. But hypocrits are of another mind; they will neither iuſtifie lawe nor goſpel, which ſhall condemne themſelues: they will not aſcribe all vnto Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that is good, and the reſt vnto themſelues: they haue means enough to doe well, they are Papiſts, they can ſupererrogate, they feele not the ſtrength of ſinne: they are not yoaked to drawe contrarie waies; like oxen they can drawe together, not as Samſons foxes by the tayles, euery one to drawe ſundrie waies: they ſuſtaine no double perſons, ſingle will they be in all their waies: they are troubled with no contrary laws, they
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:21235:166"/>can make all agree well enough, and therefore when cry they in the very deſperation of their ſoules; who ſhall deliuer vs? they giue thankes to God, not for Chriſt, but for themſelues, that they are not like other men: Therefore the ſpirit hauing not pulled downe the old building, how ſhall it be poſſible to ſet vp the newe, which is plainly to be ſeene in the chap. fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, Rom. 8.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, where is their freedome from the law of ſinne, and of death? neither Chriſt nor the ſpirit hath purchaſed it for them: and I doubt that their owne paiment will not ſtand good in Gods court. Secondly, if things may be known by their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, ſurely euerie man may ſee they ſauour of the things of the fleſh. Thirdly, if the wiſedome of the ſpirit, and the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the fleſh be enemies; I admire what peace and life can be in hypocrites, when they will not denie their owne wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: for as yet the bodie is not dead, and quickned again by the ſpirit: ſtill are they debters to the fleſh, and will liue after him. How will they prooue themſelues to bee the ſonnes of God? if the ſpirit of bondage be gone, and the ſpirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be entred into their hearts, let vs heare the cry of <hi>Abba, father?</hi> let them prooue the witneſſe of the ſpirit, if they bee heires of God, euen annexed with Chriſt: let vs ſee how they can ſuffer with him; how they eſteeme of afflictions in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of their glorie: doth the creature groane for them? nay alas, I feare againſt them, becauſe they ſubiect him vnto vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Let vs heare how they with patience looke for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: Is their hope for things not ſeene? nay alas, all for the preſent. How doth the ſpirit aſſiſt them in their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; how is he with them in their prayers; what requeſts doth he bring out of their ſoules? where be their deepe ſighes that cannot be expreſſed; can they ſearch the meaning of the ſpirit according to the will of God? ſurely nothing leſſe: for all is but lip labour. Againe, haue they aſſurance that all works to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for their good? can they tell it from their predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vocation, iuſtification, and glorification? can they from hence conclude, that God is for them, and no man can be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them? that there is no charges for them to pay? that
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:21235:166"/>there is no condemnation, no ſeparation from the loue of God in Chriſt? all afflictions cannot doe it, no <hi>death,</hi> no <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> no <hi>principalities,</hi> nor <hi>powers,</hi> nor things <hi>preſent,</hi> nor <hi>things to come;</hi> no place, not heauen aboue is too high for them; nor hell below, is able to make them ſinke into his depth: yea, in breife, not any creature is able to doe it: therefore no hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite is in Chriſt, and therefore impoſſible that he ſhould bee waſhed from his filthineſſe; beeing not waſhed, hee muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in it. And that will appeare, if we mark <hi>his life and death:</hi> life, <hi>proſperitie, aduerſitie.</hi> In proſperitie, for his profeſſion he is all courage, and verie full of brags; like the coward that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he come in the field, is fire and towe; but when he comes to the tryall, is the firſt that flees the field; when the couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous champion is very ſilent, but when there is neede of him, will ſhew, that hee hath more tried ſortitude in him, then a thouſand cowards: So hypocrites make all the world ring with their Maſter; though all the world forſake thee, yet will I not forſake thee; I will lay downe my life for thee: yet when Chriſt ſhall come with <hi>(a this night ſhall yee be put vnto it)</hi> then will they flee with the firſt: and if Chriſt haue no better cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions then they, he ſhall be left all alone. Secondly, come to the hearing of the word, all promiſes they will make their owne; all iudgements threatened, they will put vpon others: and for application of both, it ſhall be as in this place, God is like them, he fauours them aboue all with his mercies; and his iudgements paſſe ouer their houſes. Thirdly for his life, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: For aduerſitie, if God be gone, he is gone; no more ſtout words, no comming to Church, no more outward refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; but labour to make the beſt of all, Gal. 6.12. they will ſeeke to pleaſe to the face, and labour to conſtraine to their profeſſion, that they may <hi>ſuffer no perſecution for the croſſe of Chriſt.</hi> In ſpeciall for their ſinnes; when they are in miſerie, it may be they will let a word come out againſt ſome knowne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall ſinne: but with Dauid, Pſal. 51. they neuer ſtrike at the roote, to wit, their originall ſinne: for the puniſhment, Mic. 6.6. they will part with any thing they haue, to be freed from the ſtroaks of Gods rod, but the thing required ſhall not once
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:21235:167"/>come neere them. And for the thoughts of death, many a <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laams wiſh;</hi> but that is all, for their life is nothing. And laſtly, for death it ſelfe, they either die like ſtocks and ſtones; or elſe like <hi>bulls and bears,</hi> roaring and bellowing out their ſhame and confuſion. Secondly, this may be a direction to Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to approoue their ſinceritie vnto God, by alwaies ſetting themſelues in the preſence of the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Vſe conſolation.</hi> Firſt in trouble, to reioyce when it ſhall pleaſe God to try vs in the fornace of affliction, that ſo we may come forth as tryed gold refined, and made the more fit for Gods kindome. Secondly, in our welfare to truſt more in God then in our ſelues, and to count the <hi>lifting vp of Gods countenance vpon vs in the face of his anointed, more ioy of heart, then when the corne, wine, oyle, and all the pleaſures and profits of this world are increaſed.</hi> And thus much of the firſt part of Gods iuſtice, to wit, the power of it, from the <hi>efficient,</hi> in the <hi>forme,</hi> and <hi>execution</hi> of it vpon <hi>the ſinne, and perſon</hi> of an hypocrite.

                     <p>For the cauſe of this order, it is the Lord. Surely Gods wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is to be ſeene in nothing more then in methode and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: for order is not from any brutiſh nature, but the beſt and wiſeſt: ſo that the changes and multitude of alterations in this world are no caſuall matters, left in the hands of blind for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. If indeed we looke into Gods Church, and ſee the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of colours, and the inſtabilitie of them, wee ſhall either
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:21235:167"/>thinke that there is no prouidence, or elſe ſo ſtrange a proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that it ſhould contradict it ſelfe: Yet ſurely after due conſideration, we ſhall ſee all colours to paint out this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent glorie, and rauiſh vs with the beautie of it. For as the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>painter</hi> is able to diſpoſe of infinite varietie of colours in his curious worke, to ſet forth the excellencie of his skill, and produce the greateſt praiſe; which perhaps to the eyes of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant beholders in the beginning were nothing but the <hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of deformitie;</hi> yet he himſelfe knew full well that the chiefeſt of his arte was in the limming forth of that creature which afterward he meant with boldnes to commend vnto the eyes of the beholders: ſo the Lord (which in the creation repleniſhed the world with all beautifull colors, from whence all painters haue learned their arte, the very imitation of Gods worke in nature) ſhall be able to diſpoſe of all the varietie of colours in his Church, to ſhew that that piece of work which he limmed forth in his decree, (which men make a monſter) and ſince the beginning of the world, hath ſet it forth in his liuely colours, to be moſt admirable and full of beautie: or as an <hi>exquiſite Muſitian,</hi> which is able to make a moſt ſweet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the greateſt multitude of ſtrings, and in nature diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant, to ſound forth his skilfull and moſt excellent arte, which at his pleaſure can extend, or let fall, as well the <hi>trebble</hi> as the <hi>tenor,</hi> and the tenor as the baſe, and mixe them with the counter-tenors, the ſmall baſes, or what ſoeuer ſeemes good vnto his will; to ioyne extreames with middles, and middles with themſelues and all their extreames; ſo that in all his mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke is neither heard harſhneſſe of ſtroke, or vnpleaſantneſſe of ſound: ſo the Lord the beſt and moſt ſweete ſinger in all Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, is able to put downe all artes, becauſe if they ſhould ſtriue with him, they ſhould but ſtand vp againſt their maker: for he is the inuenter of them all, and men and angels are but the obſeruers of his wiſdome: and therefore all in heauen and earth ſhall meete together to ſound forth the praiſe of the Lord: and therefore the Lord can not but keepe good order in all his waies; and if he will take ſinne into his owne hands, it ſhall not be ſpoiled for want of good handling.</p>

Pſal. 37. is wholly ſpent vpon this ſubiect, that the flouriſhing eſtate of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked is but tranſitory, and deſtruction is their end: but the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the godly in this world ends in peace and quietneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:21235:168"/>they are in the fauour of God; therefore muſt they not fret or be <hi>enuious for the euill doers;</hi> for they are ſoone <hi>cut downe like graſſe,</hi> and <hi>wither away as the greene hearb;</hi> but <hi>truſt in the Lord,</hi> and <hi>doe good, dwell in the land,</hi> and <hi>they ſhall be fed aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly.</hi> Pſal. 73. yet <hi>God is good vnto Iſrael, euen vnto the pure in heart:</hi> there is the diſpute about Gods order or prouidence in gouerning of the world. The queſtion is, whether God be good vnto the faithfull. The diſputants are the fleſh and the ſpirit: the arguments are brought on both ſides, and by the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments the cauſe is determined. Firſt, the old man brings his arguments, and proues the negatiue part that God is not good vnto Iſrael: firſt, he pulls two arguments out of his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, <hi>want of wiſedome,</hi> and <hi>diſcontentednes of minde,</hi> which were the fountaine of his errour: he that can not guide his feete, nor <hi>keepe his ſteppes from ſlipping,</hi> may eaſily ſay God is not good vnto Iſrael: but I the old man ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do neither of theſe, and therefore muſt I needes thinke, that God is not good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Iſrael. Secondly, he that can not indure the proſperitie of the wicked, and the miſerie of his owne ſoule, may eaſily iudge God not to be good vnto Iſrael: but thus were my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections guided: and therefore from minde and heart, from blindnes and affection, I conclude that God is not good vnto Iſrael. But the diſcerning ſpirit may eaſily anſwer theſe obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, with a <hi>nego conſequentiam:</hi> for they are but the witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of a lying ſpirit: it is no good conſequence to ſay, that the ſunne ſhines not, becauſe I am blinde and ſee it not: no good conſequence to ſay, Gods hates me, becauſe he proſpers the wicked.</p>
                     <p>Leaue theſe inartificiall arguments, and diſpute more ſolid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from ſome artificiall thing. I will therefore beginne with their death; and thus I diſpute; He that is not drawne vnto his death as a malefactour, neither hath ſicknes on him as the meſſenger of death, but is <hi>without all bonds, luſty and ſtrong,</hi> muſt needes prooue that God is better vnto him then his Iſrael: and therefore not good vnto them: the aſſumption I prooue; <hi>They are not in trouble, with other men, neither are they plagued with them; but pride is as a chaine vnto them, and crueltie coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:21235:169"/>them as a garment.</hi> What then can be anſwered for God? ſurely ſtill the conſequence is not good: bruit beaſts may goe to the ſlaughterhouſe without all baiting, and it were queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſſe the part of a mad man, to diſturbe them that goe as heart would wiſh; neither would the deuill for a thouſand worlds, that theſe men ſhould once be diſquieted to turn back againe: and therefore yet you ſticke in the queſtion. What then will you anſwer to an argument drawne from their life; <hi>their eyes ſtand out with fatneſſe, they haue more then heart can wiſh, they haue their tongues at libertie:</hi> power to oppreſſe, boaſt of it, and yet preſume the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>y ſhall not be controlled: for they dare <hi>speake againſt heauen, and ſuffer their tongues to walke tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the earth:</hi> therefore God neither doth, neither can he do any good to Iſrael: Let <hi>Moſes</hi> come to Pharaoh, with <hi>let my people goe:</hi> he ſhall be anſwered, not as the deuills anſwered the Exorciſts, Act. 19.15. <hi>Ieſus we acknowledge, and Paul we knowe, but who are yee?</hi> It had been well if he had but ſaid, <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Moſes;</hi> God I acknowledge, and his p eople I know; but who are yee that are ſo impudent with your king? this is not his voice; but who is God? and Exod. 10.10. <hi>Let the Lord ſo bee with you, as I will let you goe, and your children: behold, for euill is before your face:</hi> Here is blaſphemie and execration of Gods people; he imagines euill againſt them, the Lord ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent it; and he deſires that the Lord had no better affection to them, then he was minded to let them goe. What ſhall be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to this proud argument that brings all into it? they haue the controlment of heauen and earth, and therefore how ſhall the Lord be good to Iſrael? Well, O fleſh, yet is God good to Iſrael: this is but a ſmall matter, for neither heauen nor earth are in their hands; it is an eaſie matter to turne their owne ſwords into their owne bowels: for they haue fedde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, but it is become a ſurfet; and therefore if preſently they be not like oxen knocked in the head, they will pine away, and neither God nor man ſhall haue profit by them: <hi>they haue been licentious</hi> but ſoone may they be cooled; they <hi>haue ſpoken wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly of their oppreſſion,</hi> but a ſmall matter will grauell them, and bring them vnto an <hi>non plus;</hi> they haue preſumed, but ſoone
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:21235:169"/>may they deſpaire; <hi>they haue ſet their mouths againſt heauen,</hi> but ſuddenly while they are about their miſchiefe, there may ſhine a moſt fearefull light, yea lightning and thunder from heauen ſtrike them to the ground, make euerie ioynt breake a ſunder, the whole bodie tremble, and the heart aſtonied: neither ſhall they heare any voice from heauen, Send for <hi>Ananias</hi> to put his hands vpon them, that they may recouer their ſight, and haue their hearts comforted: yet ſhall they heare a voyce from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, Why haue you perſecuted me; it is hard for you to kicke againſt my prickes; I will make your conſciences pricke you to the death, the ſting ſhall neuer out of it: there ſhall not be a Moſes nor an Aaron to pray for you, though you confeſſe with Pharaoh, <hi>we haue ſinned: the Lord is righteous, but I and my people are wicked.</hi>

                     <p>Surely, the ſpirit of God is ſtrong, my owne teſtimonie is anſwered; the death and life of the wicked cannot euince the cauſe: therefore I bring a third ſort of reaſons euen from the godly themſelues; v. 10. <hi>his people turne hither: for waters of a full cup are wrung out to them:</hi> Hence euen they ſay, <hi>how doth God knowe it? or is there knowledge in the moſt high?</hi> wee dare boldly ſay, <hi>the wicked proſper, and increaſe in riches: we haue clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed our hearts in vaine, and waſhed our hands in innocencie to no purpoſe: for daily haue we beene puniſhed, and chaſtened euery mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> What may be ſaid to this argument? ſurely the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of my brethren doth preſſe mee ſore: that they ſhould bee ſo diſcouraged: yet I hope when they ſhall haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered my arguments propounded for the defence of their cauſe, they ſhall recant their errour, and ſay, <hi>If I iudge thus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the generation of thy children are vp againſt mee, I haue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore treſpaſſed:</hi> the reaſon was, becauſe I thought to finde out the diſcourſe by my naturall reaſon, but I confeſſe it was too painefull for mee: therefore (O Spirit) the comforter of thy Church, let me heare the arguments that will beare waight in the ballance of Gods ſanctuarie. Firſt, therefore I will begin with an artificiall argument, which all men may gather out of the workes of God: euen of his iuſtice; <hi>They are ſet in ſlipperie places,</hi> they ſtand but vpon the yee, and therefore God may
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:21235:170"/>
                        <hi>ſoone caſt them into deſolation:</hi> which all the world may ſee to be done: for how <hi>ſuddenly are they deſtroyed, periſhed, and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conſumed?</hi> all is but a dreame of their proſperitie; but when I am awaked to ſee it, and they to feele it; then ſhall I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my heauenly felicitie, contemne all their vaine pompe, and know aſſuredly that God makes all their image <hi>to be deſpiſed:</hi> therefore I ingeniouſly confeſſe, that the <hi>vexing of my heart,</hi> and <hi>the pricking in my reines,</hi> was becauſe I was too fooliſh, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as a beaſt before God: yet was I happie in all this: for by faith I was alwaies with God; and that my faith might not fall, he hath holden me by his right hand. Secondly, for my ſelfe, I haue taken this arguemnt, that God will guide mee by his <hi>counſell, and afterward receiue me to his glorie.</hi> Thirdly, I dare appeale vnto mine owne ſoule from both theſe arguments, vnto a third, <hi>whom haue I in heauen but God?</hi> and I haue deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red none in earth before him. Fourthly, I drawe an arguments, from mine owne weakeneſſe, and the daily experience I haue had of Gods goodneſſe; <hi>my fleſh faileth, and my heart alſo: but God is the ſtrength of mine heart, and my portion for euer:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now I come to the determination of the queſtion, and thus I determine it: for the wicked, <hi>Loe, they that withdrawe themſelues from God ſhall periſh: thou deſtroyeſt all them that goe a whoring from thee:</hi> and for my ſelfe, I haue found that the deepeſt diſputations, doe alwaies bring forth the beſt conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſafeſt determinations: therefore thus I reſolue, <hi>That as for me, it is good for mee to drawe neere to God: therefore I haue put my truſt in the Lord God, that I may declare all his works.</hi>

<pb n="322" facs="tcp:21235:170"/>in diſpleaſure?</hi> what will this doe vnto my ſoule? ſurely it <hi>will prooue my death.</hi> Yet I <hi>remembred thy workes,</hi> meditated in them, deuiſed with my ſelfe what ſhould be the ende of them, and I found thy way <hi>in the Sanctuarie,</hi> whither I muſt aſcend by faith, if I meane to declare thy power among the people, to wit, thy redemption: <hi>The waters of the red ſea ſeeing thy power were afraid, the depths trembled, thou rainedſt vpon Egypt, and madeſt thy thunders to be heard, the lightning lightned the world, the earth trembled and ſhooke: thus thou didſt lead thy people like ſheepe by the hands of Moſes and Aaron:</hi> ſo that they wanted no comfort in the midſt of many waters; and all becauſe God did diſpoſe of all their troubles.</p>
                     <p>Surely that God orders all things, is a moſt admirable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the faithfull, and a reſon that I cannot leaue vnpreſſed. Thy little finger ſhall not ake, a haire of thy head ſhall not fall to the ground without Gods diſpoſition: Pſal. 121.4. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a note of <hi>admiration</hi> both to good and bad; of <hi>demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to all that expect the mercies of the Lord; and of <hi>attention</hi> to thoſe that are too negligent: and what may they all behold? euen this, that the <hi>keeper of Iſrael will neither ſlumber nor ſleepe:</hi> A keeper, what is that? ſurely to be ſet in ſome office: and therefore too baſe for the great God of heauen to become Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels ſeruant; if Dauid had not ſtyled him ſo in the next verſe, I ſhould haue beene vnwilling to haue thought it, but nowe I dare ſay it, the Lord is thy keeper, and therefore O Iſrael, thou art but as a child vnder tuition, as a ſheepe vnder a paſtor: but happie that thou art put into the hands of no gouernour, ſaue into his that gouernes the whole world; not a ſheepe left vpon the mountaines without a ſhepheard; but euen vnto him that againſt the fond conceit of the Aramites, is the God both of the mountaines and vallies: the <hi>keeper of Iſrael.</hi> Firſt, he had Iacob in his keeping, the younger brother, who when he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſtrength of his brother Eſau, became Iſrael, <hi>one that preuailed with God,</hi> and therefore ſure to preuaile with man. He had ſtood before the lyon of the tribe of Iudah, and therefore needs not bluſh at the face of Eſau. Againe, all the twelue Patriarks haue gone into Egypt, and their whole progeny ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:21235:171"/>the name of their father, and therefore were preſerued in Egypt, brought out with ioy, lead through the red ſea, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected in the wilderneſſe, and moſt ſafely conducted into the land of Canaan: and ſince that all ſpirituall Iſrael hath bin lead by Chriſt Ieſus, out of ſpirituall Egypt, through the red ſea of his baptiſme, to paſſe through the wilderneſſe of this world, vnto the celeſtiall Canaan, where they ſhall appeare in Sion. Now beloued, what is this keeper vnto Iſrael? not onely no ſleeper, but alſo free from all ſlumber: he neuer layes his eyes together, as though he were wearie with watching: Pſal. 34.15. <hi>The eies of the Lord are vpon the righteous, and his eares are open to their cries:</hi> neither hath he any neede to cloſe them vp; for it is onely proper vnto the creatures, that are wearied with labouring and watching; but the Lord is no more wearie in his care for the whole world, then he is for one of the heires of thy head. See it in his Saints: hee preſerued Noe in the great deluge, <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> in all their dangers, <hi>Iacob</hi> could not be hurt of <hi>Eſau,</hi> nor <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in priſon, <hi>Moſes</hi> cannot periſh in the riuer, nor <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the yron fornace: and therefore the heathen by the light of nature, could paint out prouidence in <hi>Argos</hi> with an hundred eyes; ſo that if one were at reſt, yet another might be waking: but the Lord is <hi>totus oculus,</hi> nothing but eie, and therefore all comfort to them, for whom he watches for good and not for euill.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Reprehenſion: firſt, the confutation of the wicked, that thinke by their diſorder to confound the Lord: indeede man is confounded in many law cauſes, and knowes not to what heades to bring ſome crimes, that ſo they may be iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the Lord wil not miſſe his ſcope for all their confuſion. Secondly, a correction of the godly, that depend no more vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God; is God thus excellent? Oh then I will neuer be from his elbowe; I will keepe me to my ſtation, that ſo when my God ſhall call, I may be in readineſſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Inſtruction: firſt, admonition to the wicked, that for ſhame they ſet ſomething in order, and leaue not all in heapes, ſeeing the God of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> means to viſit their houſes. Secondly, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be admoniſhed to deale better with their neighbours,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:21235:171"/>and bandle them more gently, for that muſt come on their skore. The other vſe, is a direction to the godly, concerning the faithful cariage of themſelues in this world. Let them haue as little to doe with the wicked as they can; for euery ſecret of them ſhall be brought to light. How would a man tremble, when he knows that any perſon is detected for villanies with whome he had to doe? be none of their receiuers, for they are theeues, and they will indanger euery one of the law that hath any thing to doe with them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. Conſolation vnſpeakable, that the Lord will haue the handling of all matters: firſt in thy neceſſities: haſt thou any wrongs offered thee? be of good comfort, for the Iudge is for thee; haſt thou any trialls? be exceeding ioyfull, the matter ſhall be caried on thy ſide, againſt the face of all thy aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries: haſt thou loſt any thing by theeues and wicked oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the world? if they now be vnknowne vnto thee, thou ſhalt haue them then detected; if thou knoweſt them, but can get no redreſſe here vpon earth, reſt quiet thine heart, the matter ſhall be amended; and for deferring of the payment, thou ſhalt receiue the whole with all the forfeits. Secondly, in thy plenty, reioyce in the Lord; for he orders all things to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe thy ſtore, and to giue thee thy fill of ioy.</p>

It ſhall then be paſt time for turning the wheele of the vnderſtanding, for diſpoſing the will to runne in her created courſe; to bring the affections to good order, &amp; place euerie member of the bodie to become a weapon of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe to ſerue uhe Lord: &amp; yet there ſhall be a ſetting; euen as a falſe peice of latin is ſet to the eye of the boy from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter by the rule, and both of them corrected; the boy by rods, the latine by pulling it in peices, becauſe it is ſo farre wanting that nothing can be made of it, that will beare good conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:21235:172"/>Indeede the godly are ſet againe into the image of their creation by Chriſt Ieſus, which hath turned man wholly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vnto his creator: and theſe haue their faults daily corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, &amp; become good proficients in the ſchoole of Chriſt: and therefore one day ſhall celebrate the happie day of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing, where euerie one ſhall be made an abſolute Doctor, free of all profeſſions; not to teach, but read a continuall le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the praiſe of God, to rauiſh his heart with ioy.</p>

If I came into a roome, and faw al the plate ſet forth to the view, euery diſh on the table in his due place, all the furniture for the chamber in anſwerable proportion, and euery gueſt in his due order and place ſet downe to meat, I could eaſily iudge of the excellencie of the feaſt. So ſurely the wicked, (alas they muſt expect no feaſt) whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God ſhal haue muſtered vp all their ſinnes, and ranked them vnder their ſeuerall heads, according to his law and Goſpel, ſhall be able ſufficiently to iudge what they haue done amiſſe, to the great diſquiet of their ſoules. Firſt, therefore they ſhall ſee their apoſtacie from God, that kept them from pleaſing of him, and made them diſpleaſe him continually: from this, will the Lord deſcend to let him ſee the tranſgreſſion in this apoſtacie, with the propagation of it to all poſteritie: he will ſhewe him that the trangreſſion in eating of the forbidden fruite, was an offence of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great maieſtie, becauſe it was a ſacrament of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of loue betwixt God the creator, and man his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and God forbad him as he would loue him, not to eate thereof. The loue on Gods part was extraordinarie, becauſe man being by nature changeable, had this ſacrament as a ſeale of his conſtant eſtate of goodnes: and therefore was it called the tree of the knowledge of good. Again on mans part, it was required that he ſhould loue conſtantly; or if he ſhould leaue to ſerue the Lord, then was affured vnto him by the ſame ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, vnder Gods broad ſeale, his change from good to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill: &amp; therfore was it alſo called the tree of the knowledge of euil. From this tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgreſſion, wil the Lord lead him by the hand
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:21235:172"/>to take notice of the cauſes, and the effects that followed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe cauſes. In the cauſes, he ſhall vnderſtand that one ſort were blameable, an other holy &amp; good: the blameable cauſes both principall and inſtrumentall: principall the deuill, which through pride againſt God, and malice againſt man, became liars and murtherers of man, by bringing him into ſinne. Man the ſecond principall cauſe, by his free receiuing of the deuills temptation, and hearkning thereunto, contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of god, when he might haue reſiſted the ſame, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a ioynt rebell with the deuill. The inſtrumentall cauſes: firſt the ſerpent, the inſtrument of the deuill abuſed, to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of the woman: the ſecond inſtrument was the woman, deceiued of the deuill by the ſerpent, became an inſtrument to deceiue man. Then ſhall he be brought to the vnblameable cauſe, to wit, the law and commandement of God; for had not this bin, their had bin no ſinne, as the Apoſtle ſaies: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the law, which in it ſelf <hi>is the ſauour of life vnto life, through the default of man, became the ſauour of death vnto death:</hi> &amp; that moſt iuſtly: for as an earthen pitcher daſhed by the hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a ſtone wall, is truely broken of the wall, yet no fault in the wall, but in the hand that threwe it againſt the wall, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the command of his ſuperiour: ſo man like this ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then pitcher beeing daſhed by the deuill, his owne free will, the ſerpent, and the woman, vpon the lawe of God, and ſo broken in peices, is no fault in the law, but theirs that daſhed him againſt the law. Therefore the lawe is no faultie cauſe, but a iuſt and holy cauſe of mans fall: and as the law did it, ſo God did it. Now the lawe was no bare permitting cauſe, or a forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king cauſe; but a working cauſe euen in that fall of man. Who ſees not the wall to haue an hand in the breaking of the pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher? and therefore it is idle to ſay, that the Lord was but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a looker on, gaue man leaue to tranſgreſſe, or did forſake him in the act; for all theſe are falſe: therefore, that which he did, he was able to doe; that which he was able to doe, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed vnto his owne glorie, and ſo it ſeemed good vnto his wiſedome; and therefore might abſolutely will that as good and iuſt. But God committeth no ſinne: true, as he did all this,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:21235:173"/>you ſee there was no fault: for what fault was there in the wal that brake the pitcher? what fault is there in the water, that drownes a man, if he caſt himſelfe into it? in the fire, if it burne him? ſurely none: therefore that which God did was iuſt and holy; but that which man did was a hainous ſinne: For God made them the fountaines and beginnings of their owne acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe they were indued with free will to doe well, that thereby they might deſerue both praiſe and price, I meane, <hi>ratione pacti, non abſolutè meriti,</hi> of bargaine, and not of ſimple merit: for that which the law would haue giuen them, that we may ſay was iuſtly deſerued: and on the contrarie, by paritie of conſequence, for ill doing they deſerued both diſpraiſe and puniſhment. If then you ſay, God might will ſinne, and not will it, which is to defend contradictions in his wil: very true is the antecedent; God did will, and not will; yet the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent is falſe: for contradictions muſt be of the ſame thing in the ſame reſpect: I may ſay, <hi>Appius eſt coecus, &amp; non eſt coecus,</hi> Appius is blind and not blind; which are no contradictions, for they are not <hi>ad idem;</hi> there is not the ſame thing affirmed and denied, but diuers: he is blind in bodie, but not in ſoule: ſo of the Lord; that which he doth in ſinne, he wills, becauſe ſo ſinne hath a reſpect of good, and he wills it iuſtly: but that which man doth in ſinne, he willeth not, but is ſore diſpleaſed with it.</p>
                     <p>Thus when the Lord hath let many ſee their tranſgreſſions, he will carie them on a long vnto the effects that flowe from theſe cauſes, as the ſtreames from the fountaine: and theſe are in number three, blame, guilt, and puniſhment: blame, the fault of his action in breaking Gods lawe: guilt, whereby hee is tyed to vndergoe his puniſhment: and puniſhment, which is the iuſt anger of God vpon him. Where by the way, he ſhal take notice of his holineſſe, whereby he is ſo pure a God from all ſinne, that he cannot away with it: ſo likewiſe of his iuſtice, whereby he is ſo exactly iuſt in himſelfe, that he cannot but execute iuſtice remuneratiue and rewarding for weldoing, and inflict puniſhment, or iuſtice vindicatiue for euill doing: yet leaſt he ſhould complaine, that <hi>ſummum ius,</hi> is <hi>ſumma iniuria,</hi>
                        <pb n="329" facs="tcp:21235:173"/>hee ſhall ſee that which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> called the moderator of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, to witte, equitie; remitting of the full extent of iuſtice: for if the Lord had dealt ſo with man, he ſhould neuer had his hand off him: for either ſhould his iuſtice haue burnt more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſely againſt ſinne, which is called <hi>anger;</hi> or more ſharpely, which is called <hi>wrath;</hi> or fully executed, which is called <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge:</hi> for as ſinnes be <hi>inaequalia,</hi> ſo ſhould the puniſhment haue beene in all theſe. Now becauſe his iuſtice may admit of theſe degrees, <hi>ratione obiecti,</hi> you ſhall ſee the Lords <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, bringing in mercy, whereby he vſeth compaſſion toward his creatures offending: Firſt, his gentleneſſe, whereby in his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice he remembreth mercy; <hi>patience,</hi> whereby he moſt gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffereth ſinners, and deferreth their puniſhment; <hi>longani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> whereby a long time he expecteth their repentance: laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>bountifulnes,</hi> whereby he being rich in goodneſſe, powreth forth his good gifts vpon them, notwithſtanding their ſinnes. And this they may obſerue by the way, in Gods ſetting of fin in order.</p>
                     <p>The infliction of the puniſhment followes by the cauſes. They may aſſure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, that euery one that had their hand in ſinne as the authors of it, ſhall be puniſhed moſt ſeuerely. Neither ſhall the inſtrument eſcape; the deuill ſhall haue his head cruſhed, and all his deuiſes brought to naught: hee ſhall be hardened in his ſinne, that he cannot repent and finde mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: and laſtly, he ſhall be vtterly baniſhed from heauen into the elements, which are reſerued, 2. Pet. 3.7. vnto fire againſt the day of condemnation, and of the deſtruction of them, and all vngodly men. The ſerpent ſhall not go without his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: a curſe ſhall bee vpon him aboue all the beaſts of the field; enmity betwixt him and the woman; and ſenſible feeling of paine in <hi>creeping on his belly, and eating the duſt of the earth.</hi> The woman, beſide her common miſerie with man, ſhee ſhall be in <hi>ſubiection to her huſband, full of griefes in her conception,</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with child, and trauaile. But for the man, his puniſhment ſhall in ſpeciall manner bee ordered, wherein all his progenie may take notice of it: his puniſhment ſhall bee with ſinne and death: ſinne originall, the exorbitation of the whole man both
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:21235:174"/>inward in himſelfe, and outward in the gouernement of the creature. Hence plainely appeares, that mans wit and will are ſet the wrong way; their faces cleane turned from God, and therefore no free will to doe any good that may pleaſe God, but vnderſtanding and will enough to do euill, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually: Againe, in the necke of this, followeth actuall ſinne, as the ſtreame from the fountaine, the branches from the root; and this is a continuall iarring of man vpon outward obiects: for originall ſinne hauing turned all the wrong way, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, that as often as any wheele in man mooueth, it ſhould meete a croſſe with euery good thing, and therefore iarre vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: yet God limits this iarring that it can goe no further then he ſhall direct it, to wit, vnto his owne glorie, and ſome particular good end in his Church. This ſin receiues degrees, (indeede the other is equall in all, becauſe the ſame meaſure metes it out vnto all) but this is a greater or leſſer ſinne in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of whom, or againſt whom it is committed: likewiſe in reſpect of the matter and manner of working it, whether it be done of knowledge, or ignorance; of infirmitis, or ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or with an high mind: and all theſe ſtand vpon two heads, ſinnes of commiſſion, in doing that euil we ſhould not do; and of omiſſion, the not doing of good that ſhould bee done: And all this will the Lord doe in ſetting in order, which ſhall be a iuſt puniſhment vpon all malefactors.</p>
                     <p>The reſt of Gods methode is more fearefull, and better felt of man, &amp; that is death; the method wherof conſiſts in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and ending of it, wherein ſhall be a continuall loſſe of life, and ſubiection to the miſerie thereof, which ſhal make vs worſe then if we had neuer beene. This death brancheth it ſelfe into two parts, the firſt and the ſecond death: the firſt death, is a ſubiection to the miſerie of this world; the <hi>inchoati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and beginning whereof, is the miſerie which comes by the loſſe of the good things of the bodie, as of <hi>health;</hi> whence commeth <hi>ſickeneſſe, deformitie, ſence of nakedneſſe, wearines, and ſubiection to dangers.</hi> Secondly, ſubiection to the miſerie which comes by the loſſe of externall things, as of <hi>friendſhip, honour, rule and dominion ouer the creatures:</hi> of things neceſſarie for this
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:21235:174"/>life, <hi>as meat, drinke, apparell, &amp;c.</hi> now the perfection of this death, is the going of the ſpirits out of the bodie, whereby the ſoule departeth from the bodie, and the bodie afterward is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued into the elements, eſpecially the earth, which did beare the greateſt part in his making. The ſecond death hath this order: firſt, it ſubiects a man to the miſeries of the world to come; the beginnings whereof are in this life, the forerunners of the extremitie of woe that are to come in the next world: the forerunners are emptineſſe of mind in regard of all good, ignorance of God, terror of conſcience, fleeing and hiding himſelfe from the preſence of God; or elſe a deepe ſecuritie, and ſenſleſneſſe of miſerie: deſpaire and a fearefull expectation of iudgement: the perfection and conſummation whereof, ſhall be an eiection from the face of God, and iniection of the ſoule, immediately after the firſt death into hell; a reſeruation of the bodie in the graue as in a dungeon, againſt the day of iudgement, when after the reſurrection both ſoule and body ſhall be caſt into the ſame place, which is prepared of God for the eternall puniſhment of the wicked, both angels and men; where is nothing but <hi>weeping, wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth:</hi> there ſhall be found no <hi>Limbus puerorum,</hi> or purgatory, but either heauen or hell muſt be their reſting place.</p>
                     <p>Neither will the Lord breake his methode, or leaue them any cauil for ſome defect: with what reaſon can the Lord ſo deale with men, ſeeing all that wee haue heard is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Adam? muſt the children ſmarte for the fathers ſinne? I hope that God is more iuſt. Well, conſider that the Lord will not leaue this without his order: for all the poſteritie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from Adam and Euah by ordinarie propagation, as they ſhould haue had happineſſe, if they had ſtood;
<note place="margin">Propagation of ſinne.</note> ſo are they obnoxious to all theſe miſeries, hefalling. And this is done iuſtly by all kind of lawes: firſt of <hi>nations;</hi> for Adam was a prince of all his poſteritie, who couenanted with God for vs, as well as for himſelfe, for performance of obedience: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he breaking, we breake: likewiſe by the law of inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; he was our father, &amp; we his heires; he was the root of all mankind, and we were in his loynes: the manner is by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:21235:175"/>of the tranſgreſſion, and ſo conſequently of blame, guilt, and puniſhment. Originall ſinne is conceiued in vs by our next parents, and ſo goes a long to all poſteritie: bodie and ſoule are the excellent worke of God: as if a skilfull workeman ſhould make all the wheeles of a clocke verie artificially, but being put into the hands of an vnskilfull prentice, is ſo diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly ſet together, that one wheele cannot go aright: ſo God the maker both of bodie and ſoule, hath left them to our firſt parents, and ſo conſequently to our next parents to put them together; who hauing loſt their firſt ſtanding with God, are become not onely vnskilfull, but alſo vncapable of any vertue, to put together a man brought forth in the image of God; for as this was onely Gods creation, ſo muſt it againe be the new creation of God: ſo that man and woman being not the cauſes of bodie and ſoule, but of the procreation of a third thing ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from both, may truly be ſaid to beget a man according to their owne image and ſimilitude. Laſtly, it is true that euerie man ſhall beare his burden; for actuall ſinne is not conueyed in ſpeciall, but in generall; ſo that euerie one ſhall anſwer for his owne actuall ſinnes, without hee followe his forefathers ſteps, and then ſhall he be puniſhed for both, becauſe he will needs haue both imputed vnto him; the firſt by nature, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond by imitation. Therefore if man may ſee in this world thus much of Gods placing of ſinne, (for this is but our obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation:) what ſhal then this God of all order do, when he ſhal not only ſet it forth, but apply it to our hearts and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? then ſhall we experimentally know the cauſes of all our miſcheife; the conſequents in the guilt of conſcience, and the puniſhments both vpon ſoule and bodie: ſo that that which is in this world both ſinne and puniſhment, ſhall be felt of vs in hell, in no other regard but as puniſhment.

                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Reprehenſion: firſt a confutation of the wicked, that thinke as they haue done all in the darkeneſſe, ſo the darknes ſhal couer them for euer: but Pſal. 139.12. the darknes hideth not from thee, but the night ſhineth as the day, the darkeneſſe
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:21235:176"/>and light are both a like. Secondly, correction of the godly, that are troubled about this point more then any thing in the world. Pſal. 37. and Pſal. 73. and Pſal. 77</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Inſtruction: firſt admonition of the godly, to conſider what is the cauſe of all diſorder, and the true rule of all refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: he ought to correct his heart, in iudging ſo hardly of religion; for that often is made of him the cauſe of all trouble. Again, to reforme that general crie; the poore they cry againſt the rich, and the rich againſt the poore; the prodigall perſon againſt the couetous, &amp; the couetous againſt the ſpend-thrift; the man of pleaſure againſt the ſtupid perſon, and the ſtupid perſon againſt the man of pleaſure: all crie out againſt ſinne, and if euery mans cry were true, then no man ſhould prooue a ſinner: but the cry plainely ſhewes, that <hi>totus mundus poſitus eſt in maligno,</hi> the whole world is ouerflowne with ſinne, but no man will ſee it in himſelfe. Well, a good method would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy all this. Thirdly, this may admoniſh the wicked, that they haue variety of ſinnes, becauſe method is a diſpoſition of varietie: for what order can be ſeene in one thing? Fourthly, that ſinnes are linked together: for methode is of one thing vnder another, and ſo drawes in another: and therefore it were good they would conſider of that drawing of ſinne as with cart ropes. Fiftly, to take notice that God can make his light ſhine vpon their dunghills, euen to reueale them, and ſet them in open view: therefore let them be more wary, for the leaſt of their ſecrets ſhall not eſcape this light. Sixtly, let them know that they ſhall haue their ſinnes propounded to their owne view, and to the view of the whole world: for methode pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds euery thing to be veiwed. Seuenthly, that this ſhall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the whole myſterie of ſinne: for there is one word more that ſets forth the verie forme of methode, and that is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly placing of all things: for a man may be a long time ſetting on the ſcore, but neuer in any good order: for our fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenters of Ale-houſes ſet on a pace, but neuer in any good order; ſo ſinners ſet on a pace: they drawe many a ſcore for future payment: but their lines are ſo confuſed, that if they would at any time caſt vp their accounts, it would be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible

                        </gap> therefore hath the Lord well put in thoſe words, <hi>in order;</hi> ſo that now they may he aſſured that the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning ſhall come to ſome yſſue: ſurely ſetting much on the ſcore among men often times makes broken reckonings, and ſo they fall together to quarrelling, and ſpend much more at the lawe: but this ſhall be remooued by the Lord; for this pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in order ſhall be done preſently; for the Lord in a briefe table will bring vnto remembrance all his ſinnes. I ſaid in my lawe, thou ſhalt haue none other gods before me: now know that before mee were all things, and mine eyes ſaw all things in a moment; and therefore from this lawe I ſhewe that thou haſt had many thouſand gods before me, which now I ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee. Secondly, I commanded thee to take heede of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any image or ſimilitude of me; but thou haſt made as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of me, as thou haſt thought thoughts; for euery thought of thee was to make me like thy ſelfe; and therefore if in an howre thou can thinke multitudes of thoughts; then conceiue that in thy whole life thou haſt had a world of idolatrous thoughts. Thirdly I ſaid, that my name was a glorious name; and therefore bad thee be exceeding carefull of it; yet many waies haſt thou taken it in vaine, <hi>in thought, word, and deede:</hi> In thought thou haſt taſhly conceiued of me; how often haſt thou aduiſedly, and with great deliberation, prepared thy ſelfe to ſpeake of me? nay alas, how often hath there ſtarted out out of thy mouth, <hi>O God, O Lord, O Ieſus, O Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> if thy mouth when thou waſt an infant can teſtifie of this, that thou neuer ſhed a teare, without, <hi>O Lord,</hi> in thy mouth: then waſt thou vnwiſe, and knew not the value of this name: and ſince thy infancie, thou haſt turned thy facultie and abilitie in this thing to an exquiſite habite, and readie promptneſſe; ſo that without either ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, how often haſt thou ſet thy thoughts aboue Gods? &amp; giuen more honour vnto thy owne name, then vnto Gods? ſurely thy truſt and confidence in thy ſelfe, will be a plaine argument for this. For words: firſt, for idle words; what ſwarmes of them haſt
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:21235:177"/>thou brought forth: ſecondly, <hi>profane ſpeeches, blaſphemous oathes, curſing of Gods prouidence,</hi> in wiſhing miſcheifes, and plagues vpon thy poore creatures, whether men or beaſts: and many rotten words which this my lawe will preſently reckon vnto thee. For my Sabbaths, how haſt thou ſanctified them in thy ſelfe, and all that belong vnto thee? haſt thou not profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them thy ſelfe, and ſet all thy ſeruants to do the ſame? wel, in a word, there was neuer a Sabbath ſpent in the whole courſe of thy life, that I had any glorie at all by, and looke thou not for any iot of glorie with mee. Fiftly, for thy father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all thy ſuperiours; how haſt thou honoured them? let thy conſcience tell thee how often thou haſt curſed the King in thy priuie chamber? how often thou haſt contemned my Magiſtrates? how often rebelled againſt father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? For murther, my law is but a word, thou ſhalt no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thou ſhalt not commit adulterie: but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten haſt thou runne in conſent with adulterers; and when thou could accompliſh thy deſire, thou waſt not wanting in the practiſe. For ſtealing, how often hath thy neighbour ſuffered wrong by thee? For falſe witneſſe, thou haſt not ceaſed to ſlander, and falſely to accuſe thine owne mothers ſonne. For coueting that which is not thine owne, thou haſt not ceaſed night nor day from this offence: And therefore thinke of this order, and thou ſhalt haue a volume of ſinnes come into thy mind. For I may tearme thy conſcience nothing, but <hi>lex appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata:</hi> for when theſe things ſhall be applied vnto thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, thou ſhalt ſufficiently be reſolued of this ſetting ſinne in order.

                     <p>The ſecond inſtruction is for the godly, that they <hi>walke cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly, not as fooles, but as wife, redeeming the time, becauſe the dayes are euill:</hi> and ſo much the rather, becauſe by this means God ſhall bee more glorified in the condemnation of the wicked: for it is naturall vnto men to excuſe themſelues by others: Why are you ſo ſtrict in our accounts with vs? you can winke at oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Two men walking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and hauing a dog to follow them, as long as they goe together, no man can iuſtly tell who is the owner, but when they part, the dog wil follow his maſter: euen ſo in the world, while we walke in it, no man knows who ownes the goods of the world; yet when the world and we part, it ſhall plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that they were the goods of the world, &amp; ſo they return vnto the owner: therefore happie is he that hath made him freinds of them, that ſo God may receiue him into his taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle. That nation that for the ſpace of three yeares would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot vnto their prince all that he could wiſh, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his three yeares were expired, then was he to be baniſhed for euer into the worſt place they could imagine, and there to liue in miſery the reſt of his life: one prince among al the reſt is commended, for that the whole time of his glory, he gathered together and fent ouer before-hand, into the Iſle whether hee ſhould bee baniſhed all neceſſaries: ſo that after he was remoued from his throne of dignitie, hee liued a more comfortable life then all the time of his pompe in the world. So ſurely euery Chriſtian labouring in this world to vſe all good bleſſings of God to his glory, ſhall be ſure to finde ſtore of heauenly bleſſings when they ſhall part with this world: he were a foole that trauailing by the high way, and beeing exceeding thirſtie, and meeting with a pleaſant riuer, could not be content to ſatisfie the thirſt of his ſoule, and ſo let the riuer runne on, but he would diuert the courſe of the riuer another way: ſo euerie man that liues in this world, and can not be content to vſe the things of this world, for all his neceſſities they can ſupply vnto him; but he will change the courſe of them, and thinke that they ſhall for euer bleſſe him; and giue his ſoule reſt, not for manie yeres, but for euer.

This diſorder we may plainly ſee in the firſt of Rom. from the 21. ver. to the end: Firſt, of the mind, vanitie and blindnes; vanitie in ſtrange purpoſes, blindnes in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of them, and diſorder which runneth with them both, and ſuffereth nothing to bee carried vnto his ende: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore maketh all the purpoſes of wicked men to end in vanitie.

Indeede in the 2. of Tit. v. 11. it is ſaid, that <hi>the grace of God that bringeth ſaluation vnto all men hath appeared, and teacheth vs that we ſhould denie vngodlines, and worldly luſts: and that we ſhould liue ſoberly, and righteouſly, and holily in this preſent world:</hi> but alas, vngodlines and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts put forth themſelues, as euidently as they did when the Lord kept backe his glorious appearance of grace. Some Chriſtians celebrate a Chriſtmas day indeede, which if the name onely were changed, a man might iudge it to be a day of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> the feaſt of Epicures, rather then the feaſt of Saints. Againe, it hath made a confuſion of all places: for how ſhall Chriſtians diſtinguiſh betwixt the heathen gentiles that neuer knewe the Lord, and them that haue made a profeſſion of his name? ſurely if it were not the worke of the Lord, many of their workes would teſtifie, that Gentiliſme, Iudaiſme, Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme, and Chriſtianiſme, were all one. Thirdly, it hath made a confuſion of all Callings, inſomuch that no man can diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh by the liues of men, betwixt a calling, and a recreation: for if recreations be not callings, then many a gentleman will
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:21235:181"/>prooue himſelfe to haue no calling. Fourthly, in actions, good or bad; neceffarie, or indifferent; ſeaſonable, or vnſeaſonable, ſinne makes all one. Fiftly, of perſons, old or young; prince or people, magiſtrate or meane perſons, ſuperiour or inferiour, Paſtour or flocke, all is one: for ſinne, will ſet the boy againſt the aged; people, Prince; inferiours, ſuperiours, and all ſhall be of the ſame profeſſion. And God tells Iſrael, Oſe. 4.9. <hi>there ſhall be like people, like priosts;</hi> which beareth the ſame ſenſe in all the reſt. And therefore if we looke into court and country, citie &amp; towne, village and houſe, we ſhall ſee ſinne will be the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-maſter. Hence <hi>ambition</hi> wil order all in the court; <hi>couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> in the country, <hi>pride</hi> in the city, <hi>deceit</hi> in the towne, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, theft, &amp; ſwilling in villages; contentions and braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in families, the wife againſt the husband, and the husband againſt the wife, father againſt the ſonne, and ſeruant againſt maſter; ſo that he that would eſpie out any order in the world, may not with <hi>Diogenes,</hi> take a candle at noone day, go vp and downe the market to ſpie out an honeſt man; but if he were compaſſed about with all the ſtarres in heauen, and had all the light in the world, he were not able to ſpie out any order in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny corner of the world, except that which the Lord himſelfe hath done, &amp; will perfectly accompliſh hereafter. And as ſinne is in all theſe, ſo are ſinners; <hi>the oxe knowes his owner, and the aſſe his maſters crib; the crane, turtle, &amp; ſwallow their appointed times; but euen Iſrael hath not knowne, Gods people hath not vnderſtood.</hi> For place, if God ſhall ſay vnto man, as he did vnto Moſes, Exod. 3.5. Moſes, Moſes, put thy ſhooes off thy feete, for the place whereon thou ſtandeſt is holy ground; Chriſt may ſay, my houſe ſhall be called a houſe of prayer; and the Preacher may ſay to euery one, take heed vnto your feet, when ye come into the houſe of God; yet none ſhall with Moſes, put off his ſhooes, hide his face, be afraid to looke vpon God: for they will ſtare him in the face, euen ſtanding in all their filthines: they will make the houſe of God, a denne of theeues: and for all that the Preacher hath ſaid, be ſo farre from hearing, that they will offer without all controlment the ſacrifice of fooles. For Callings, it is as eaſie to pull the ſtarres from heauen, as
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:21235:181"/>to make ſome gentlemen leaue their pleaſures, or they that are giuen to a wandring life, to ſet themſelues to ſome honeſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, whereby they may glorifie God, profit Church &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and liue honeſtly among their neighbours. For actions, men neither care for honeſtie, nor diſhoneſtie, but <hi>ruſh into ſinne, as the horſe doth into the battell; and drinke in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, as the fiſh doth water.</hi> As for perſons, what care and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience make men of their companie? they can ſhake hands with euery bodie, be moſt at eaſe with the wicked, and ſolace themſelues with thoſe that hate God. And therfore the point is cleare, that the world is full of diſorder, and confuſion. The reaſons whereof are theſe;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe that ſinne and ſinners, <hi>breake all Gods li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,</hi> and wil be kept within no compaſſe, vntill the Lord take ſinne and ſinners, and chaine them vp for euer, with the deuill in hell.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Becauſe ſinne <hi>confounds all mens memories:</hi> for take a ſinner, either in Church or Common-wealth, to giue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts either to God or man, of that which they truſted him withall, and you ſhall finde him ſo confounded with the ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his maſters goods, that he cannot tell iuſtly how any penie is put forth for his maſters profit: therefore at the day of iudgement, when the Lord ſhall call for his talents, wicked men ſhall be ſo confounded, that they haue nothing to ſay, but away with me wretch into the place of my torments.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Is from <hi>the nature of ſinne,</hi> which accepts of all without diſtinction: it careth not how it comes by any thing, whether by hooke or by crooke (as we ſay:) and therefore ſinne beeing a great gatherer, and keeping no booke, either of receits or expences, muſt needes make confuſion when it comes to the reckoning: and therefore neither the giuer, nor the ſpender, ſhall haue any profit by it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Vſe</hi> reprehenſion: Firſt, confutation of the wicked, that make no account of the day of Gods reckoning with them: but let them be aſſured, that Gods booke is neither croſſed, nor made vp in this world: and therefore muſt they looke to anſwer hereafter. Secondly, correction to the godly, that can
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:21235:182"/>not be content to let God be croſſing his book in this world, by afflicting and puniſhing of them: let them know, that God is iuſt, and ſinne muſt haue ſmart: therefore either in this world, or in the world to come: and bleſſed is he that hath it in this world.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Vſe</hi> inſtruction: Firſt, admonition to the wicked, to ſhew them plainly, that if they will haue their fill of ſinne in this world, they ſhall haue their paiment of it hereafter: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they will ſtand to their taske, they ſhall be ſure to ſtand to their perill. Secondly, direction to the godly, that they <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, and ſtrengthen the things which remaine;</hi> remember what they haue receiued and heard, concerning the Lord Ieſus, and hold it faſt, and repent of their wants; leaſt he come on them as a thiefe, and they know not what houre ſhall be the time of his approach.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Vſe</hi> conſolation, in all eſtates to him that diſpoſeth his way aright; becauſe the Lord will ſhew vnto him, the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſoule. Pſal. 50.23.</p>
                     <p>And thus much concerning the Order of Gods Iuſtice in the Cauſe, Forme, and Effect.</p>

Therefore (right Worſh.) patronage a fewe verſes of a bad Poet: I haue deſired to make them ſauourie meat: if they taſt harſhly, excuſe the cooke for his good-will, as ready to make amends in the next ſeruice: if they want arte, or be dreſſed without their ſugred ſauce, I hope a good appetite wil ſerue inſteed of that ſeruice.

Hence <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientia, quaſi ſcientia qualis quiſquis ſit:</hi> a true knowledge what manner of perſon euerie man is. 1. Ioh. 3.20. If our heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne vs, God is greater then our heart, and knoweth all things: if our heart condemne vs not, then haue we boldneſſe toward God: this Paul found in himſelfe, 1. Cor. 4.4. but hee would not iuſtifie himſelfe by it. This on the contrarie, made the accuſers of the woman taken in adulterie, creepe out one after another, Ioh. 8.9. In all men this <hi>beares witneſſe of the law of God written in their hearts,</hi> Rom. 2.15. It calls old ſinnes to remembrace, and makes men afraid of the puniſhment of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Gen. 50.15. It is a grieuous wound for ſinne committed, and alwaies cries vengeance, Gen. 4.14. By cuſtome of ſinne, the conſcience is become fleſhie, (not ſoft, but hardened:) Firſt, that it looſeth all feeling of ſinne, Epheſ. 4.19. and ſecondly, incurable by any ordinarie ſurgerie, for as a <hi>Schirrous</hi> place in the bodie, or that which is become to haue a <hi>Canker</hi> in it; <hi>oyles</hi> will not mollifie it, <hi>plaiſters</hi> and ſalues cannot heale it vp, only a hot yron muſt burne it out, and ſo bring the place againe to feeling: ſo many a mans conſcience is ſo hardned, that nothing will cure it, but hell fire, and the worme that neuer dieth, 1. Timoth. 4.2. I haue ſhewed how many wayes the conſcience
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:21235:185"/>is brought to feeling: the hot yrons that God vſeth, are in number three: The firſt is ſome <hi>general amazement</hi> or aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the heart, by ſome ſudden, fearefull, and extraordinary iudgement, Dan. 5.9. The ſecond, is made hote by ſome <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular acknowledgement of ſome particular ſinne,</hi> Matth. 27.3. Laſtly, by the laſt iudgement, Reu. 20 12.</p>
               <p>Conſcience <hi>quiet</hi> and not <hi>good,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Kinds of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> is of the ſecure and careleſſe liuer; <hi>good</hi> but <hi>not quiet,</hi> is of the broken and contrite ſpirit, which the Lord will neuer deſpiſe: the conſcience <hi>neither quiet</hi> nor <hi>good,</hi> is of the deſperat ſinner: <hi>quiet and good,</hi> is of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian come from vnder the ſtorme and tempeſt of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and reſting in the ſweete ſenſe and feeling of the mercies of his God in Chriſt Ieſus, ſealed vnto him by the teſtimonie of the ſpirit of God. The conſcience meant in this place, is the quiet, but not good conſcience, awaked by the fearfull iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God to tremble and feare: Zecha. 5. vntill <hi>the flying booke came forth, which is the curſe of God, the woman (which is wickednes,) ſitting in the middeſt of the Ephah, is preſſed with a weight of lead, and ſtirreth not:</hi> but now the Lord, euen by a weake meanes of <hi>two women, hauing the wind in their wings, lifts vp the Ephah betweene the earth and the heauen, and then the whole earth which ſits at quiet, ſhall be mooued and eſtabliſhed for euer in the land of darkeneſſe and obliuion.</hi> Therefore becauſe the Lord knowes that he ſhall finde the whole world aſleepe when he comes to iudgement, bids them that loue him <hi>watch, &amp; take heede of ſecuritie.</hi>

                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Of all miſeries that can befall man, none like to the <hi>ſetting of ſinne before the eyes of the conſcience.</hi> The Lord in this Pſalme is extraordinarily offended with the hypocrite: and for his plague hee puts this one for all, <hi>I will ſet thy ſinnes before thee.</hi> Alas,
<note place="margin">The children of God often wra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle with horror of conſcience.</note> the children of God often feele the wrath of God kindled againſt their ſoules, and anguiſh of conſcience moſt intolerable, and can find (notwithſtanding continuall prayers, and inceſſant ſupplication made vnto the Lord) no releaſe, but in their own iudgement ſtand reprobate from Gods couenant, and voide of all hope of his inheritance, expecting the conſummation of their miſery, and fearefull ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:21235:186"/>of eternall condemnation; when perhaps theſe are but temptations riſing from their owne nature; or els without them, by the malicious enemie Sathan; or from ſuch allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or terrors which the world toſſeth vs with all: in theſe <hi>Sathan</hi> is a worker, beſide his owne peculiar manner of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which is <hi>poſſeſſion,</hi> or a more liberty and freedome to the tempted of ſorrow and deſpaire, and quicke diſpatch of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. For comfort of the godly I will inſtance a little in theſe leſſer temptations, and then I wil inlarge them to the wicked whoſe cauſe is deſperate.</p>
               <p>Of our owne natures ſpring the temptations which riſe of the roote of originall ſinne,
<note place="margin">The ſpring and fountaine of all temptations.</note> without any forraine inſtigation from the world, whatſoeuer is either a baite of pleaſure, or fright of terror, which increaſe the actuall ſinnes ſpringing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the originall roote, and lay as it were compaſſe, and powreth on water to that vngracious ſtock, to make it grow the faſter: Now all theſe temptations are not of that dangerous nature that this is of: here muſt we attend with patience the iſſue, which not onely is certen, but alſo ſhal come in the beſt time. The <hi>corporall inhabiting of Sathan,</hi> is the greateſt, fulleſt of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and deſpaire, that can befal the godly: yet the <hi>hiſtorie</hi> of the deeds and ſayings of Chriſt, the writing of the <hi>Euangeliſts,</hi> do teſtifie of whole legions diſpoſſeſſed of that habitation, by the power of Chriſt mercifully extended vpon ſuch miſerable captiues: which examples ſerue againſt like times of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that we giue not ouer hope, though <hi>millions of deuills ſhould poſſeſſe vs</hi> within, &amp; enuiron vs without: but knowe his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be aboue all force of the enemy, and his mercie farre ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting Sathans malice: therefore Gods children haue no cauſe in this ſort to feare, nor haue any ſhadow of ground, wheron they ſhould reſolue againſt themſelues vpon the point of reprobation: but that all theſe moleſtations and terrours which they now indure, are temptations rather of their father for good and profit, then grounded reſolutions of ſuch lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table iſſue.</p>
               <p>Againe,
<note place="margin">The order of the deuill in drawing Gods elect into A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme, and ſo on concerning his ſoule, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or faith.</note> for more praticular examination, I find by daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that theſe are as well the operations of phanſie from
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:21235:186"/>melancholie, as of conſcience for ſinne: that methode of which temptation, I find for the moſt part to runne in this order: Firſt to call into queſtion, whether there be any God or no; for <hi>melancholie</hi> is a diſputing humor. Secondly, when reaſon hath maſtered that, then the ſecond queſtion is about the <hi>immortalitie of the ſoule.</hi> When that again is conquered, there enters a third queſtion, whether we <hi>profeſſe the true religion,</hi> or no. When that is expelled, the fourth queſtion, that maketh the greateſt tumult in the ſoule, is whether wee haue any part or portion in that which it promiſeth. Here the deuill is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding buſie; for if this be reſolued on, he is wholly caſt out, and hath nothing further to trouble vs withall. Any of the former doubts would haue ſunke our ſoules: for if no God, then why ſhould I abſtaine from my ſinfull pleaſures? If againe no refur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, then why ſhould I vexe my ſelfe in this world? If my religion be falſe, then muſt I haue a new; &amp; twenty to one but I change amiſſe, and therfore I wil be of no religion: but when I ſhall begin to thinke I haue no faith in Gods promiſes;
<note place="margin">Whether me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie be the affliction of conſcience.</note> then alas, what ſhall comfort me? Therefore conſider theſe queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: firſt, whether the conſcience of ſinne, and the afflictions thereof, be melancholy or not: ſecondly, what is the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: thirdly, the afflictions of mind, to what perſons they befall, and by what meanes: fourthly, what may be the conſolation. And ſo from this ſetting before the eies of the conſcience on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in appearance, I will proceed to the reall, and that which the Lord will do to the hypocrite in this place.</p>
               <p>For the firſt,
<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them.</note> the affliction of conſcience is quite another thing then melancholy; as may appeare out of the ſecond que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion by the differences: Firſt, in the <hi>cauſes:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cauſes.</note> the one is a meere fancie, without all true and iuſt ground, and is onely raiſed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diſorder, or humour in the fancie, and raſhly deliuered to the heart, which vpon naturall credulitie fareth in paſſion, as if it were indeede, whereof the fancie giueth a falſe alarum: But the other is a ſorrow and feare vpon cauſe, and that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt cauſe that worketh miſerie vnto man. Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. Effects</note> in the <hi>effects:</hi> In that of conſcience, the bodie is ofttimes in firme ſtate of health, perfect in complexion, and perfect in ſhape,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:21235:187"/>and all ſymmetrie of his parts, the humours in quantity &amp; qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, not exceeding nor wanting their naturall proportion: but in the other, the complexion is depraued; obſtructions ſpoile the courſe of humour and ſpirit, whereby the blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ouer-groſſe, thicke, and impure, and nature ſo diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that diuerſe melancholike perſons, haue iudged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſtrange creatures, as hiſtorie will plainly record. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<note place="margin">3. Subiect.</note> 
                  <hi>in the ſubiect:</hi> The ſenſes in the other both inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward are ofttimes perfect, the <hi>imagination</hi> ſound, the <hi>heart</hi> wel compact, and reſolute, and this excepted, want no courage: but in the other, both inward ſenſe and outward are too fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; the fancie ouertaken with ghaſtly fumes of melancholy, and the whole force of the ſpirit cloſed vp in the dungeon of melancholy: darkeneſſe imagineth all darke, blacke and full of feare, their hearts are either ouertender and reare, and ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily admit the paſſion; or ouer cloſe of nature, ſerue more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily to impriſon the cheerefull ſpirit, the cauſes of comfort to the reſt of the body. Hence they are faint hearted without oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, onely driuen with the tide of that humour to feare e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the middeſt of ſecuritie.
<note place="margin">4 From the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall.</note> Fourthly, they differ in the <hi>fountaine and originall of them;</hi> the one begins in the minds ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion; the other in the diſtempered humour, which delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the organicall actions, abuſeth the mind, and draweth it into erroneous iudgement,
<note place="margin">5 Cure.</note> through falſe teſtimonie of the outward report. Fiftly, <hi>in the meanes of cure;</hi> the one is hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by no medicine, no purgation, no cordiall, or balme, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>balme of Gilead,</hi> are able to aſſure the afflicted ſoule &amp; trembling heart, panting vnder the terrors of God, <hi>hell, death, and damnation:</hi> But in melancholy paſſions, the <hi>vaine</hi> opened, <hi>neeſing powder or Bearefoot</hi> miniſtred to expell the fumes in the braine; cordialls of <hi>pearle, ſaphyres, and rubies,</hi> with ſuch like, recomfort the heart throwne downe, and appaled with phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticall feare.
<note place="margin">6. End.</note> Sixtly, they differ in the <hi>ende:</hi> in the one the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill is not of bodie, and corporall actions; but of foule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, to be cut off from the life of God, &amp; from the ſweet influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his fauour, the fountaine of all happineſſe, and eternall felicitie. Here then the cauſe, is the ſeueritie of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:21235:187"/>ſummoning the guiltie conſcience: the ſubiect, is the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſoule, apprehending the terror thereof, which is for euer and euer: the iſſue, is eternall puniſhment, ſatisfactorie to the iuſtice of the eternal God, which is endleſſe, and whoſe ſeueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie admitteth no mediation: and this extends not to one ioynt, ſinew, or vanie, but to all; neither that of the bodie onely, but of the ſoule, whoſe nature as it is impatible of all other things, in greateſt peace, aſſurance, and tranquilitie; ſo bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once ſhaken by the terrours of Gods wrath, and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with the whirlewind of his diſpleaſure, it faileth, and with it driueth the whole frame of nature into extreame miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and vtter confuſion. The other hath for his cauſe a dry and cold humour, whoſe ſubiect eſpecially is the <hi>spleen</hi> ſwolne vp with windines and hardneſſe vnder the left ribbes: the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents are, the <hi>hemeroydes</hi> not flowing, blackneſſe and groſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of blood, fearefull dreames, ſolitarineſſe, ſadneſſe. And therefore thoſe are to be condemned, which make the terrors of conſcience nothing but melancholie, and thereby labour to benumme the ſenſe of that ſting, which ſinne euer carrieth in the tayle, and turne men to their vſuall pleaſures; and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude the foole and ſimple in his waies, skilfull to doe euill, ſottiſh in the pathes of righteouſneſſe, and vtterly ignorant of her rule; and wherein nature giueth ſome ſparke of light, more diſtinctly to diſcerne: yet they turne them out of the way, and make them like to ſtubborn and <hi>vnbroken horſes,</hi> ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off reaſon, deſpiſing her mannage, and layeth the noble rider in the duſt: theſe be <hi>Salomons fooles,</hi> that follow wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, <hi>Like an oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a foole that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the ſtockes for correction, and as a bird haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing that he is in danger.</hi> But beſide theſe, another ſort are iuſtly taxed, euen the Phyſitians themſelues, who when their patients come vnto them for phyſicke, and they ſpie out their diſeaſe to be melancholy, aske them vnder what miniſter they liue, &amp; if they mention ſome conſcionable man that deals truely with mens ſoules, giue the parties counſell not to heare them, but get from them as farre as they can: Alas, are not theſe diſtinct diſeaſes, and therefore what wretched per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:21235:188"/>are thoſe, that labour to turne a diſeaſe that is not vnto death, into one that is both the death of bodie and ſoule.</p>
               <p>For more particular differences, conſider: That whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the mind, according to theſe ingrauen lawes of nature, which no man is voide of be he neuer ſo barbarous, raiſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moleſtation directly, it is no fancy but a caſe of conſcience. The verie teſtominie of the heathen doth ſufficiently witnes this point: whoſe Poets according to their receiued opinions, haue fained <hi>Hecates, Eumenides,</hi> and the infernall furies; whoſe force <hi>Seneca</hi> in his tragedie of <hi>Hercules furens,</hi> hath moſt liuely expreſſed. Theſe indeed are but fained perſons, yet the matter vnder this maske is ſerious, true, and of wofull experience. This was <hi>Cains</hi> marke; the ſpirit that poſſeſſed <hi>Saul; Iudas</hi> the traytour by this wound, tooke the reuenge of <hi>betraying the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> vpon himſelfe with his owne hands: ſuch was the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh that <hi>Eſau</hi> felt when he found no repentance, after he had <hi>ſold his birthright for a meſſe of pottage:</hi> and ſuch is the ſtate of all defiled co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences with hainous crimes; whoſe hearts are neuer free from the worme, but with deadly bite thereof are driuen to deſpaire. This may the more plainely appeare, if we conſider how the ſoule may ſuffer of the body in <hi>life, ſenſe, and motion:</hi> The body is a great troubler of the ſoule, not in his being, but in his actions: hence may he cauſe <hi>madneſſe, ſtrange imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſudden feares, dolefull apparitions, feebleneſſe of bodie,</hi> and <hi>want of heart</hi> in the performance of any action: but the <hi>mind</hi> &amp; <hi>will</hi> of man, are of ſuch excellency and perfection, that they are not directly patible of any thing, but of God alone that made them: ſo ſtandeth both mind and will in awe of none but of him: neither admit they any other violence, then from him <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whoſe hands it is moſt terrible to fall.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">No calamity comparable to the diſtreſſe of conſcience.</note> All diſeaſes of the bodie may haue ſome medicine, either to cure them, or to mitigate &amp; aſſwage their paine: for all ſores <hi>Chirurgie</hi> hath a ſalue: <hi>freinds</hi> helpe pouertie: there is no impriſonment, but there is <hi>hope of libertie: ſuite and fauour</hi> recouer a man from baniſhment: <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and time</hi> weare out reproch. But what phyſick cureth? what chirurgerie ſalueth? what riches ranſome? what counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance beareth out? what authoritie aſſwageth? what fauour
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:21235:188"/>releeueth theſe troubles? yea if all ſhould band themſelues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in league, though they would conſpire a confederacie, yet could they not preuaile. If our <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> were an hoſt of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med men; if our <hi>freinds</hi> were princes and gouernours of the world; if our <hi>poſſeſſions</hi> were as large as Eaſt and Weſt; if our meat were <hi>manna fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen;</hi> if euery day like the day of <hi>Chriſts reſurrection;</hi> if our <hi>apparel</hi> as coſtly as <hi>Aarons Ephod;</hi> yet al theſe would little comfort vs. This cauſeth ſuch diſtreſſe vnto thoſe that feele the torment hereof, that they would redeeme it gladly, if it were poſſible, with the verie loſſe of their liues, which often they aſſay to doe: that this might off their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, they would be content, if it were poſſible, to ſuffer all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinds of miſerie at the verie ſelfe ſame time. This giues no warning, as the diſeaſes of the body doe; for in them we find the <hi>head</hi> beginne to ake, or <hi>ſtomach</hi> trouble vs, <hi>laſſitude of body, remoov<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Here the purity of the blood, and the ſincerity and liuelines of the ſpirits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile nothing to mitigate the paine: it drieth vp the <hi>blood,</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth the <hi>marow, pineth</hi> the <hi>fleſh,</hi> conſumeth the <hi>bones,</hi> makes <hi>pleaſure painefull,</hi> ſhortens <hi>life;</hi> no <hi>wiſedome</hi> can counſell it, no <hi>counſell</hi> can aduiſe it, no <hi>aduiſment</hi> aſſwage it, no <hi>aſſwagement</hi> cure it, no <hi>eloquence</hi> perſwade it, no <hi>power</hi> ouercome it, no <hi>ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> affray it, no <hi>inchanter</hi> charme it. A man languiſhing in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as long as he is heart-whole, he hath hope of recouery: he that is in reproach among men, and yet can remember that he is in fauour with God, will not much care for the ſhame of the world: he that is baniſhed out of his owne country, and yet remembreth that he is a citizen of the kingdom of heauen, will not be ouermuch grieued: but the wound of conſcience is ſo deadly, that he dare not ſue vnto him that ſhould be the only phyſitian of it, becauſe he thinks that he is his onely ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. Alas, who dare meet with the Lord of hoſts? who can put to ſilence the voyce of deſperation? who will make an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the hells of conſcience? what compact with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill? In all other afflictions, there is ſome comfort againſt ſinne: but this is alwaies accompanied with the accuſation of ſin: this
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:21235:189"/>breeds hurliburlies in men, that when it is day, he wiſheth for night, when night, for day: his meat doth not nouriſh him, his dreames terrifie him, his ſleepe forſakes him; when he ſpeakes he is little bettes, when he keeps ſilence, he boyles in diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes, the light doth not comfort him, and the darknes doth terrifie him.

In melancholie the heart is troubled with vaine ſeares, vpon euery ſmall obiect: the very eye by a falſe apparition, may ſtrike him; the eares with the imagination of euery voice
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:21235:189"/>ſounding, may dolefully appale him; a very touch may make him ſtartle, and many ſuch like troubles, which are <hi>whelps of that melancholie litter,</hi> bred of that corrupted ſtate of bodie, altered in ſpirit, in blood, in ſubſtance, and complexion. This may increaſe the terrour of the afflicted minde, double the feare and diſcouragement,
<note place="margin">How diſtemper of body may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe this wound, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all cure by counſell and aduiſe.</note> and ſhut vp all meanes of conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for it muſt enter by the ſenſes to the minde. Now the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of ſenſe beeing altered by the humour, and their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie ſtained with the obſcure and darke ſpots of melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, receiue not indifferently the medicine of conſolation. As the braine, the original and fountaine of all ſenſe and motion, is thus euilly diſpoſed; ſo the heart, the cheriſher and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of our nature, beeing in no better caſe, and acquainted with terror, and ouerthrowne with that ſearefull paſſion, imptiſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the ſpirits, contracts it ſelfe, and hardly yeilds to perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of comfort whatſoeuer it bringeth of aſſurance. For though the griefe ſtrike down at the firſt, reſpecting no time, place, perſon, condition, or opportunitie of working, but breaketh through all ſuch conſiderations, and beareth downe all reſiſtance; yet the comfort requireth them all: and the miſſing of one, makes the affliction to be long and hard in the cure. The Comforters perſon, his manner of handling the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, the time, and place of performance, with the braine and heart, which are as the gates and entrance vnto the ſoule, may hinder or aide the conſolation.
<note place="margin">No diſtemper can hinder the inward comfort of Gods grace.</note> But all this is to be vnderſtood of outward meanes: for the inward meanes, to wit, the grace of God, and his mercie, his comfortable ſpirit and gratious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour in like ſwiftnes without meanes, may reſtore the minde thus diſtreſſed; which lieth open equally to the kind of cure, euen as it lay to the wound. Therfore ſeeing the body workes nothing vpon the mind, altogether impatible of euery beeing, ſauing of God alone: and ſecondly, that the efficient can do it without helpe of the bodie; and thirdly, that the comfort is not procured by any corporall inſtrument, nor the diſcomfort directly procured by the ſame; &amp; laſtly, becauſe all is done by cauſes in ſubiects, nothing corporall and producing effects of an other nature then corporall, it muſt needes bee concluded,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:21235:190"/>that there is great difference betwixt theſe two troubles. The puniſhment of bodily racking, is not the paſſion of the heart, but a cauſe of it: ſo that racking of the ſoule by ſinne, is not a melancholie paſſion, but yet may it cauſe it, and therefore makes the diſtinction not ſo cleare: for oftentimes the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of a diſeaſe, is taken for the diſeaſe it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>The affliction of mind,
<note place="margin">The perſons which are hable to this ſorrow.</note> to what perſons it falleth, and by what meanes, is thus to bee reſolued: All men are ſubiect to this by reaſon of our fall, the breach of Gods lawe, and the wrath of God that followeth thereupon: yet of all ſorts of men, melancholie perſons are moſt ſubiect vnto it: not from the humour, but becauſe he is moſt doubtfull and iealous of his eſtate, for life temporall and life ſpirituall. For temporall, phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians and apothecaries ſhops will beare ſufficient witnes; for if they be able to walk, we find them for the moſt part in theſe places: And I would to God they were as readie for their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life to bee with Gods ſpirituall phyſitians, and in the ſhops of the true <hi>balme of Gilead.</hi> By experience we find, that when they beginne to examine how their actions anſwer the naturall and written line of righteouſneſſe, and wanting the <hi>arch-pillar of faith,</hi> and aſſurance in Chriſt Ieſus our hope, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently feele the very anguiſh due vnto ſinners, and in that moſt miſerable condition fall into flat deſpaire.</p>
               <p>The manner how this is done is, when the curious melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie perſon, carrieth his mind into the ſenſes of ſuch myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<note place="margin">How it befalls them.</note> as exceed humane capacitie; and is deſirous to knowe more then is reuealed in the word of truth: and yet being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of that which is reuealed, he ſuddenly falls into the gulfe of Gods ſecret counſells, which ſwalloweth vp all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of man or angel; and meaſuring the truth of ſuch depths by the ſhallow modell of his own wit, is caught and deuoured of that, which his preſumptuous curioſitie mooued him to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to apprehend. Of this we haue a memorable example of a vertuous <hi>gentlewoman</hi> in this land, who was carried along in this courſe, doubting verie often of her ſaluation, and making her caſe known vnto a worthy miniſter of God; he often cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felled her, to take heede of inquiries further then Gods word,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:21235:190"/>and truſt aſſuredly that ſhee might conclude her ſaluation out of Gods word, without any further reuelations: yet ſtill did the temptation grew vpon her, inſomuch that hauing a <hi>venice glaſſe</hi> in her hands, and the ſelfe-ſame miniſter ſetting by her, preſently breakes forth into lamentable words; You haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten told mee, that I muſt ſeeke no further then Gods word, but I haue been long without comfort, and can indure no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; therefore if I muſt be ſaued, let this glaſſe be kept from breaking; and ſo ſhe threw it againſt the walls: Here might the Lords hand for this tempting of his maieſtie, haue left her to the euerlaſting woes of her diſtruſtfull heart: yet the Lord that is rich in mercie, hauing ſtamped her with the ſeale of his election, was content to ſatisfie the languiſhing ſoule with a miracle: the glaſſe rebounds againe, and comes ſafe vnto the ground; which the miniſter hauing gotten into his hands, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, Oh repent of this ſinne, bleſſe God for his mercie, and neuer diſtruſt him more of his promiſe: for now you haue his voyce from heauen in a miracle, telling you plainly of your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. This was curioſitie, and might haue brought deſpaire; yet it was the Lords mercie to remit the fault, and graunt an extraordinarie confirmation of her faith.</p>
               <p>But to proceede: melan cholie perſons that are giuen to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,</hi> if they be not well grounded in the word of God, and haue reſolued in all their <hi>ſpeculations,</hi> not to remooue one haire from the ſame, are eaſily ouertaken, and plunged in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie: and eſpecially all ſuch as haue their vocation conſiſting in ſuch ſtudies as philoſophie, &amp;c. which if they cary not a low ſaile, and ſometime to ſtrike, and lie at the anker of the Scriptures of God, but hoiſt vp ſaile, &amp; leaue it to the tempeſt of preſumption, are preſently carried into the whirle-poole of Gods infinite ſecrets, and are in daunger (without the ſpeciall grace of Gods mercie) neuer to deliuer themſelues: for theſe men being not balanced with knowledge of Gods ſcriptures, and aſſurance of his ſpirit, are neuer able to abide the vglines of their ſinnes, when they ſhall once be vnfolded, &amp; that nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row point of reprobation and election, propounded vnto their melancholie braines and hearts, and moſt miſerable pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:21235:191"/>ſoules. Others which haue but ſome little knowledge of Gods word, and practiſe anſwerable, for want of the true ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending of Gods reuealed will touching election and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and the right methode of learning and conceiuing the doctrine, cauſeth them to ſtumble and fall at this ſtone: for a ſword taken at the wrong ende, is readie to wound the hand of the taker, yet held by the handle, is a fit weapon of defence: ſo Predeſtination prepoſterouſly conceiued, may through fault of the conceiuer, procure hurt; whereas in it ſelfe, it is the moſt ſtrong rock of aſſurance, in al ſtorms of temptations that can befall vnto bodie or ſoule; becauſe predeſtination is Gods immutable will, the cauſe and rule of all iuſtice, and vttermoſt of all reaſon in his workes. Now if reaſon aſcending to this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame cauſe, deſcend not againe to the meanes, then when our ſinnes ſhall meete with Gods iuſtice, and we haue no eye to looke vpon his mercie in his ſonne Chriſt, we ſhall find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the aſſurance of our owne deſtruction. Againe, if with the world, we eye alone his mercie, and conſider not his iuſtice, then miſerable man, who <hi>melteth as ſnow,</hi> and <hi>vaniſheth like a vapour</hi> before his iuſtice, muſt needes periſh eternally, in that his careleſſe preſumption. Againe, as the melancholie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in generall, and ſecondly in ſpeciall: 1. of giuing himſelfe to contemplation, 2. knowing Gods word vngroundedly; ſo in the 3. place, this makes the melancholie nature ſubiect to this paſſion, when with a paſſionate humour he reads G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A fourth ſpeciall manner in this <hi>melancholike ſubiect,</hi> is the good and chriſtian heart, the waight of whoſe ſinnes excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:21235:191"/>for a time the ſtrength of their faith, ſee not ſo clearely as they deſire; but euen as in a ſtormy tempeſt, the ſhip ſeemeth at euery blaſt, and ſourge of the ſea, to be in danger of wracke; and as the young aſh, bending to euerie blaſt of wind, ſeemeth in perill of breaking, and rooting vp, when notwithſtanding both the ſhip keepeth her conſtant courſe, and the tree yet hath the rooting. In winter, we thinke the trees are dead, and in a tempeſt we thinke wee haue loſt the brightnes of heauen; yet ſummer prooues the contrarie, and the ſpace of an houre may ſhewe the cleare heauens againe. So when this tempeſt of Gods anger is ouer-blowne, and his gracious countenance beginneth to ſhine on vs againe, then the ſaith which was as it were hid for a time, taketh life, and ſheweth foorth it ſelfe, and plainely prooueth, that as the trees when they bud in the ſpring time, and bring forth fruite, were not dead in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as they ſeemed; ſo the faith of Gods children ſpringeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, after the ſtormie winter of temptation, and therefore no dead faith. The diſeaſes of the bodie, make vs ſometime ſeeme little better then dead corpſes, and yet the hidden life is after recouered and raiſed vp againe. Thus ſaith by reaſon of our owne weakenes, and thorough Sathans tempeſtuous malice, bendeth, ſeemeth feeble, and yeeldeth to the force; while not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it is built on the rocke, and planted with the hand of God in the Eden of his gracious election, and doth remaine a plant for euer in his Paradiſe of euerlaſting feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie.</p>
               <p>Thus the lilly of God, and euerie member of it, though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many thornes, is preſerued; becauſe they are planted by the good husbandman, watred with the dewes of heauen, hedged and preſerued by his continuall care: for this husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is night and day in his field, and yet he neuer <hi>ſleepeth,</hi> no not ſo much as ſlumbereth, by his watchfull care for Iſrael his flocke, Pſal. 121. In deed we had need of a good ſhepheard; for wee are extraordinarie wandring ſheep: we had need of good gouernours; for we are but punies in our wayes: we had neede of a good guide on the ſeas of this world; for we are but like vnexperienced trauailers by ſea, fearing euery weauing of

               <p>But Sir I pray you,

So then, all men are ſubiect to afflictions of conſcience, melancholie perſons eſpecially.

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſuch as are negligent in reading, and practiſing. Thirdly, ſuch as are humorous. Fourthly, ſuch as are weake in faith. The meanes that brings all this vpon vs, is ignorance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie: now leaſt Gods children ſhould vnaduiſedly diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God in this kind of ſorrow, who is the <hi>God of peace and comfort;</hi> we will ſhew that this <hi>ſetting of ſinne before their eyes,</hi> is greater matter of comfort then ſorrow; and ſo hauing ſaued Gods children out of this fire, by yeelding them that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort which the Lord promiſeth to euery broken and contrite heart, ſetting his ſinnes before his eies, that ſo he may eſcape the iudgement of God, which ſhall be ſure to fall vpon all hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:21235:192"/>when no comfort ſhall be found for them, either in beauen or earth.</p>
               <p>For the godly, let them reſolue, that ſinne muſt haue ſmart: therefore the Lords ſending affliction vnto his children is, becauſe he would not haue them freeze with the wicked world in their dregges. If God puniſh not in this world, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God is vniuſt, or els there is a hel to puniſh them in euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly: but his children, if they profit not by one, he ſends another to condemne them in the world, that they may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape in the world to come. Secondly, as that is Gods ende, ſo they ſhall finde that this is Gods ordinarie way to doe them good: Iam. 1.12. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that is tried, for when he is tried, he ſhall receiue the crowne of life.</hi> Luk. 24.26. it is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended of our Sauiour Chriſt, as a matter arguing great igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and infidelitie, not to know and beleeue that this was his portion, and ſo conſequently a thing to fall vpon all them that would liue godlily in him: 2.

               <p>Marke therefore the arguments, as grounds to be laid in all our afflictions: they are in number fiue.

Thirdly, the ſubiect of all other pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is but like vnto a ſtone, that beeing ſtricken with the
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:21235:193"/>hammer and clouen in pieces lies ſtill, neuer vnites his parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; but this patience, when his ſubiect is euen beaten to powder, and is ſcattered abroad, is able to bring all together againe, ioyne ſoule and body together, euen almoſt diſioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for lacke of ſpirit and courage: and ſo to animate body and ſoule, that euen Chriſtians ſhall ſay, I neuer found body and ſoule in better temper then now. Many Martyrs which haue beene troubled with the ſwelling of the ſpleene, which all the time of their libertie was a kinde of hell vnto them, haue admired that beſide the exraordinarie conſolations of the ſoule, they haue felt thoſe paines ceaſed that did diſquiet them on the day time following of their ordinary vocations, and in the night with breaking off their ſleepe, when now they finde that all the day they could toyle in writing and praying, ſinging and comforting their poore brethren, and when night comes, ſleepe ſoundly without either bed or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering; when before, though vpon a <hi>bed of Ivorie,</hi> and <hi>wrapped in ſilke,</hi> they could take no reſt this is Gods bleſſing filling the heart with the grace of patience, which makes vs <hi>perfect, intire, and lacking nothing:</hi> therefore where patience is, what diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort can trouble vs?</p>
               <p>This is the firſt argument, marke the method to the ſecond. It might well be obiected; I could be patient, but I want wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to carrie mine affliction, and make the right vſe of it. To this he anſwers, and his anſwer doth not onely take away the obiection, but giue a ſecond confirmation of his exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, v. 5. <hi>If any of you lacke wiſdome, let him aske it of God,</hi> and ye ſhall be aſſured that the Lord will anſwer you: <hi>for he giueth to all men liberally, and reproacheth no man:</hi> therefore you his children ſhall be ſure to ſpeede. Yet would I preuent all raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, for if it may be had for asking, then all men ſhall haue it: for who is he but he praies the Lords praier, Creed, ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements? true: it is he ſaies praiers, but I giue the requiſite: let him aske in faith, and wauer not: for he that wauereth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth, firſt the ſhame of inconſtancie, becomming like the ſea toſſed of euery winde, and neuer reſting. Secondly, they looſe all expectation euer to receiue any thing of the Lord;
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:21235:194"/>nay, let him not ſo much as thinke of it, or preſume that the Lord will anſwer his praiers. Thirdly, the detection of an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, that he is a double minded man; and therefore vnſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in all his waies, not able to lie at the anker of any of Gods promiſes. Now then both arguments beeing rightly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and applied vnto the ſoule, ſee how forcibly they will be able to inferre the concluſion. He that hath ſuch a patience that is perfect in it ſelfe, and is able to worke perfection in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and that in ſuch ſort, that they ſhall be made perfect, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, lacking nothing; and ſecondly for direction, ſhall haue the bleſſed grace of ſpirituall wiſdome, may be mooued to count it exceeding ioy, when he falls into diuers tentations: but euery faithfull ſoule ſhall haue both theſe graces: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt he needs intertaine my louing exhortation. Patience and wiſdome going hand in hand, will carrie affliction with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trouble: for ſuppoſe that two perſons were to carrie a long ſtaffe through a ſtrait paſſage, the one wants patience, and therefore he makes haſt; now for want of wiſdome, his ſtaffe falls a croſſe, he is ſtill diſcontented, labours to breake through by violence, but the ſtaffe beeing too ſtrong for him, and the paſſage too narrow to let him goe on, except he take his ſtaffe with him is ſet at a ſtay to adde croſſe vnto croſſe, vntill he periſh in his follie: now a man of patience, when he is to come that way, is content by patience to goe ſoftly, at his leiſure, and by his wiſdome eſpies where he may haue a thruſt backe, except he order his ſtaffe, by letting one end go before the other; and thus by patience and wiſdome goes further in the ſtraits of this world toward the kingdome of heauen in one houre, then fooles, <hi>wiſe in their owne conceit,</hi> goe all the time of their life.</p>
               <p>But let me lead you on in the Apoſtles ſweete conſolation, and bring you to the third ground, and that is true contentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all eſtates, v. 9, 10, 11. explained by an example in aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, and another in proſperitie; proouing that neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie can further the ioyes of Chriſtians, nor aduerſirie hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it: and therefore whether proſperitie or aduerſitie befall
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:21235:194"/>them, their eſtate is all one with God. For aduerſitie, he brings for inſtance an example drawne from pouertie, ver. 9. <hi>Let the brother of low degree reioyce in that he is exalted:</hi> his lowe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree is no hinderer of his exaltation in Chriſt, and therefore can it not take away his reioycing: for what cares a man for the loſſe of a pennie, that is ſo rich that he knowes no ende of his wealth: for better is it to bee made rich by the creator of the world, then to haue the creature without the creator. For proſperitie, he exemplifies in riches, v. 10. It is good for him that is rich, <hi>to ſee that he bee made lowe,</hi> elſe ſhall he with his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches become as the <hi>flower of the graſſe, which by the ſunne wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the graſſe, makes his flower fall away, and then the goodly ſhape of it periſheth;</hi> euen ſo ſhall the rich man <hi>wither away in all his waies.</hi> And therefore ſeeing the beſt in proſperitie is to bee made low, and the worſt is to be made rich without humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and on the contrarie, the worſt in aduerſitie makes vs the beſt in Chriſt; who can denie but that our ioy may exceed in afflictions?</p>
               <p>The fourth argument beſide his ſtrength and power is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry alluring, for Pſal. 4. <hi>who will ſhewe vs any good?</hi> well, if in this caſe any beleeuing Iew ſhall make the queſtion in this anguiſh of his ſoule, and ſay, who will ſhew vs any good? he ſhall not onely haue the Apoſtle, with Dauid, to ſhew them that God will lift vpon them the light of his countenance; but euen the bleſſed ende of all their tryalls: v. 12. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth tentation: for when he is tried, he ſhall receiue the crown of life, &amp;c.</hi> But if there be ſuch ſtrong arguments for tentations, then ſurely God is the cauſe of them: No beloued, I would not haue you ſay God tempts any man, v. 15. but the true cauſe is his owne heart, v. 14.15. therefore <hi>erre not my deare brethren,</hi> v. 16. but take notice of euerie good gift, and ſay that is the Lords worke, v. 17. therefore this good that comes out of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil, is the worke of the Lord: for afflictions in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are euill, and it is my power to make them good vnto my children, yet not to make them in my children. Therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing giuen warning, take the fift argument of conſolation and
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:21235:195"/>comfort; and that is from the newe birth, v. 18. <hi>A woman in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede when ſhe trauaileth hath ſorr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now that compleat ioy may be drawne out of all theſe arguments, it is neceſſary that the word of God be ſpecially looked vnto; for in afflictions it onely giueth vs the liuely ſight of our ſinne, manifeſts the riches of the mercies of God in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus to deliuer vs from ſinne: and therefore Dauid ſaies often, <hi>but for thy lawe I had periſhed in mine afflictions:</hi> therfore for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comfort, he ſhewes what is required to make vs profit in Gods word; firſt, <hi>qualification;</hi> ſecondly <hi>practiſe:</hi> the firſt, the ſoule: the ſecond, the life of the ſoule: the qualification, v. 19. the reaſon of it, v. 20. and the concluſion out of both, ver. 21. <hi>Wherefore laying apart all ſilthineſſe, and ſuperfluity of malitiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, receiue with meekenes the word that is grafted into you, which is able to ſaue your ſoules.</hi> After this qualification, followes the practiſe, that the mercies of God might not be in vaine, which he hath beſtowed vpon them: therefore v. 22. be <hi>ye doers of the word, and not hearers onely deceiuing your ſelues:</hi> now becauſe this couſening of our ſelues in hearing of Gods word, is a diſeaſe incident to the moſt; hee playes the good Phyſitian: firſt diſcouering the diſeaſe by a familiar ſimilitude, laying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether theſe fowre tearms, ſpots and a glaſſe, ſins and the law: as ſpots may be ſeene in a glaſſe, ſo ſinnes may be ſeene in the law: ſecondly, in their qualitie wherein they are laid together, and that is beholding, conſidering, and immediately forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; as a man beholding falls to conſider ſomething amiſſe in himſelfe, yet going his way, and other matters poſſeſſing his head, immediately forgetteth what manner of face-he had: So they come to the Church, looke into Gods word, conſider that all is not well; yet going their way home againe to their olde courſes, and now all is ſpoiled, and they are neuer better.

<pb n="370" facs="tcp:21235:197"/>Lord hath told vs that this is the way to heauen, to paſſe by many croſſes; we run a long and find no ſuch matter, well may we ſuſpect that we are out of the way: and then aſſuredly that our pleaſant way did not affoard vs ſo much comfort, but the want of the ſignes will as much diſcomfort vs: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore affliction may more comfort vs, then all worldly pleaſure, becauſe the Lord hath made the one a ſigne we are going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward heauen,
<note place="margin">Heb. 12.6.</note> but the other none at all, ſaue onely of our iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neying toward hell. But you may obiect, that euerie croſſe is not a marke: for firſt, the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt is a mark of reprobation: ſecondly, impenitencie: and therfore when he hath theſe ſinnes in the eies of his conſcience, how ſhall he be perſwaded, that he can euer be brought into the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen? For the anſwer of this point, let vs conſider a threefold fountaine of this perſwaſion. Firſt, for that open and wilfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſie from God, is a voluntary willingnes &amp; malitious ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt the profeſſion of a knowne truth: now the fruits will iudge the cauſe: Is there in you the renouncing of Gods truth, which before you haue profeſſed &amp; heartily embraced? perceiue you this malice proſecuting this miſchiefe? what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution doe you remember in word or deede you euer raiſed againſt the truth? what ſword haue you euer drawn againſt it? or what volumes haue you either written or approued againſt found doctrine, with purpoſed oppoſition againſt your owne conſcience, neither that of frailty, but of meere will, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie? of this, examples are rare, as Iulianus the Emperour called Apoſtata. Of the ſecond, impenitencie, there is the ſame fountaine, but not in the ſame degree; and that is extremitie of hardneſſe of heart: of which kind was Cain, Eſau, Saul, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, &amp; many of the prophane people of the world, that know not Chriſt: and ſuch as knowe him onely in vaine profeſſion outwardly, and ſo continue, are partners of the ſinne, and ſhal be examples of Gods vengeance. This fountaine cannot be in them that ſinne onely againſt their conſcience: for then ſhould euerie man be guiltie of it: when the ſinne was committed, we may remember that the illumination of our vnderſtanding, &amp; the regeneration of our wills did oppoſe it; but both beeing
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:21235:197"/>weake and imperfect, we were drawn vnto the euill. And here before I come to the ſecond fountaine, I propound a briefe diſtinction of temptations; ſome touch our faith, whether we beleeue or not; otherſome the fruits of faith, either of profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the truth, or els of obedience ſutable and kindly to our profeſſion: the former is tryed by perſecutions, feare, fauour, &amp;c. the ſecond concerning perſons, poſſeſſions, and good name, is knowne by charitie in keeping of the ſecond table. Now theſe are not the things that exclude Chriſts propitiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſacrifice, except incredulitie, bringing forth impenitencie, and vtter renunciation of the faith, be ioyned with them. But here we often heare the cries of Gods children; alas, I beleeue not, &amp; therfore draw vpon me the paine due to the vnfaithfull. Here I would intreat euery one to waigh with circumſpection, and due conſideration, his owne eſtate in ſo waightie a point as this. And therefore let him be aduiſed, that there be other two fountaines that may ſcare our ſoules with theſe feares. The firſt, is corporall infirmitie, deluding the heart and braine, whereby ſtrange imaginations are wrought in our heads, and dolefull paſſions in our hearts: theſe things alwaies vrge terror and diſtruſt, and deludeth vs with opinion of want of that, whereof we haue no lacke: as others often are caried with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion and confidence of thoſe things whereof they haue no part. Aetius reporteth that Phylotimus was faine to put a cap of lead vpon a Melancholickes head, that could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded he had any head at all, vntill at the length feeling the waight to oppreſſe him cryed out, my head akes: why the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaies his freinds, you haue a head. Artemidorus the Grammarian, did imagine that he wanted both an hand and a legge, when euery man els could iudge it was but a fancie, from which he could not be recalled to his dying day. So often deales the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill with vs, by deluding of our phancies, that we want both head and heart to God-ward, and that we haue diſpoſed both to him-ward. But many a bleeding ſoule may go further: what tell you me of melancholie, it is a diſeaſe that I am free from? well, let that be granted (yet rare it is to finde perſons without it, that are touched with this kinde of griefe,) yet we finde a
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:21235:198"/>third fountaine, that may without all deluſion ſtreame this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of bitternes, as the ſenſe of our ſinnes may pricke vs, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch as moſt hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe, and are poore in ſpirit, and broken in heart: yet this is an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble token of grace, that they long after the liuing God, and their ſoules pant for him: Oh when ſhall I enter into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence? Oh men of God, what ſhall I doe to be faued? The reſt of the world (except ſome vengeance of God lay hold vpon them, or ſome horrible fact gnaw their wounded conſciences) paſſe their time in blind ſecuritie, careleſſe of God, and empty of all ſenſe &amp; hope of a better life: theſe paſſe their daies, and finiſh their courſes, as the calfe paſſeth to the ſhambles, not kowing his ende to be ſlaughter by the butchers knife. You therfore that truly grone vnder the burden of your ſinne, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of your error: you iudge your faith by inward feeling, and your actions proceeding therefrom, by your thirſt of righteouſneſſe and preſence of your wants. Here you iudge by the quantitie of faith, and not by his vertue; when a very <hi>graine of muſtard ſeed,</hi> a little <hi>ſmoking flax,</hi> or a <hi>broken reed</hi> may ſuffice with God to bring forth a <hi>tree,</hi> a <hi>burning fire,</hi> and a <hi>ſtable plant</hi> of righteouſneſſe: for both the ſenſe of faith, the ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the fruits, and increaſe of the meaſure, are all the gifts and graces of God diſpenſed vnto vs, according to his owne wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, making moſt for his glory and our good. If we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but the extemity of our miſery, the leſt ſparke of faith may giue vs a world of comfort; and the ſmalleſt worke of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence performed in ſincerity, though not in perfection, may perſwade vs of the ſame loue of God, as though we were as ſtrong as our father Abraham, or any reſolue martyr that hath ſealed his religion with his blood.</p>
                  <p>But the Chriſtian ſaies, I haue no feeling of Gods grace, and therefore no faith: I anſwer, true faith may bee without feeling, and therefore it is dangerous to iudge the want of faith,
<note place="margin">Faith without feeling.</note> by the want of feeling. That this is the truth, let theſe be the grounds of it: Firſt, a man may reſt vpon God, and yet want the feeling of the loue of God; as <hi>Iob. Dauid,</hi> the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> &amp;c. Iob: 13.15. <hi>God is mine enemie, the arrowes of
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:21235:198"/>the Almightie drinke vp my blood, he makes me as a butte to ſhoote at:</hi> here Iob hath none of the feeling of Gods loue towards himſelfe, but he hath not loſt his loue and fath toward God: for he ſaith, <hi>though the Lord ſhould kil me, yet would I truſt in him.</hi> Dauid, Pſal. 22. <hi>Oh my God, I crie by day, but thou heareſt not; by night, but thou giueſt no audience:</hi> neither night nor day had he any feeling that God did heare his prayers, or graunted his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts; but yet he was not without faith, for he made this prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in faith, and that with ſpeciall application <hi>(my God.)</hi> The Canaanitiſh woman had fowre repulſes; 1. ſilence. 2. deniall; <hi>I am not come but vnto the loſt ſheepe of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> 3. the Apoſtles to ſpeake againſt her, <hi>ſend her away, for ſhe crieth after vs.</hi> 4. a wofull remembrance of her miſerable eſtate, <hi>Woman, it is not good to take the childrens bread, and caſt it vnto dogges:</hi> in all theſe, Chriſt ſhewes her ſmall comfort, yet ſhee hath not loſt the feeling of her ſaith: for ſtill ſhee cries, <hi>Truth Lord, yet the dogges may eate the crummes that fall from their maſters table.</hi> And ſurely all that can thus hang on the breaſts of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, are children of hope that neuer miſcarrie; but at length af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many ſcourges, ſhall heare the admirable voyce of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, <hi>I haue not found ſuch faith in any, goe away in peace, and be it to euery one of you according to your faith.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Hee that will reſt vpon the meanes of his ſaluation,</hi> though he finde not any ſweetnes in the performance of them, is a true beleeuer, though hee feele not his wiſhed ioy. Wilt thou goe to beare Gods word, and frequent the places of his worſhip? wilt thou <hi>pray, read, conferre, meditate, &amp;c.</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all theſe in obedience vnto God, though thou feele no ſweetneſſe in them? then aſſure thy ſelfe, that reſting vpon Gods meanes for comfort, thou haſt true faith, and that cannot but at length make thy ioy to breake forth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. He that with all his heart can <hi>wiſh the ſaluation of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny member of Chriſt,</hi> is a true member of Chriſt, and ingrafted into Chriſt by a liuely faith; now theſe diffreſſed ſoules can wiſh with all their hearts the ſaluation of others; and therfore it cannot be, but they ſhould be of Chriſts bodie, and haue in them the true life of that bodie for a member of the world
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:21235:199"/>can neuer in vpright ſinceritie, wiſh the wel-fare of Chriſts bodie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. They that moſt <hi>complaine of their corruption</hi> from the true ſenſe and feeling thereof, are ſanctified by the ſpirit of grace: for corruption cannot complaine of corruption, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one ſinne become an enemie to another; but grace alone complaines of corruption; and the law of the ſpirit, oppoſeth the law of the fleſh: nowe it is prooued by experience, that none complaine more of ſinne, then the poore Chriſtian affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in conſcience: neither is this their complaint that of the wicked; for they crie out of the ſenſe and feeling of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhment, but theſe for that they ſhould ſo diſpleaſe God: O therefore lift vp your hearts, and cry with Dauid, Pſal. 51. <hi>Lord reſtore vnto vs the ioy of thy ſaluation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, let vs conſider with whom we fight, and for what crowne, and how both heauen and earth mooued at our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; and the ſame power concurred thereto as in our firſt creation; and therefore the worke beeing ſo great, no maruell if we vndergo many an heauie burthen, be put to many a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous lift, yet the foundation is ſo ſurely laid, that it muſt vp in ſpight of all oppoſing power: For as the great and mighty <hi>oakes</hi> are ſlower in attaining their full growth, then the <hi>ſhrubs</hi> and <hi>weedes;</hi> whoſe enduring is for many yeares, and for <hi>time out of mind,</hi> (as we ſay,) when the other in ſhort time wither and fade away; ſo muſt Chriſtians eſteeme their increaſe of heauenly graces, ſlowe, but ſure, and euerlaſting as immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that they may bee <hi>as a beame, or a pillar in the temple of God for euer and euer:</hi> for the life of grace is no naturall life, but ſpirituall, therefore no way corruptible: for if it were ſo, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions would be true, that ſpirituall life ſhould bee natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall life, incoruptible corruptible, and immortal mortall. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here let vs be deceiued in iudging according to our ſenſe, or meere ſhewes of things; for then the moſt fruitfull <hi>trees,</hi> in winter ſhall be taken for barren, and the <hi>luſtie ſoyle,</hi> dry and vnfruitfull, while it is ſhut vp with the hard froſt: but reaſon and experience prooues the contrarie; <hi>faith the spirituall ſheild</hi> in this our ſpirituall war-fare, endureth much battering, and
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:21235:199"/>many brunts, and receiueth the forefront of the encounter, &amp; oftentimes fareth as if it were peirced through, and worne vnfit for battell, whereupon we lay it aſide: yet euen for all this it proues inuincible, and repelleth whatſoeuer engine the enemie inforceth againſt vs, and ſtandeth firme rooted, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſtorme <hi>Sathan</hi> raiſeth for the diſplacing thereof: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the ſenſe of faith is dulled in vs, and the fruits mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter diſcontentment; remember that the graces and <hi>mercies of God are without repentance,</hi> and Chriſt Ieſus whom he <hi>loueth he loueth vnto the ende.</hi> Suppoſe that fire were extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fixed in the cold water, ſo that you would ſay there can be no coldneſſe at all in the water; yet conſider that cold is ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall to the water, that ſecretly he will driue out the heate, and make it apparent that the fire had no place there but by v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation: ſo faith in the ſoule of man aſſiſted by patience, when man in the verie fire of affliction, will by little and little bring out ſinne, and with ſinne the puniſhment of the ſame: ſo that it ſhal clearly appeare that faith doth but eſteeme of them both, as tenants at will.</p>
                  <p>Oh conſider this, that our goodnes did not mooue God to beſtowe his mercie vpon vs, neither ſhall our ſinne cauſe him to remooue it: for he ſaw them before be gaue vs his mercie: why did he not then withhold his mercie? ſurely as he <hi>knew vs when we were ſtrangers from him,</hi> and loued vs when we hated him, and had nothing which might prouoke his mercie but our miſerie: ſo is his goodnes continued vpon vs ſtill <hi>for his owne ſake,</hi> and not at all for our deſeruing, but for that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes ſake which is in his Sonne, and that oblation of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vp; not for himſelfe, but for others: and therefore with whome he was well pleaſed for that ſacrifice, with them ſhall he ſtill be well pleaſed: otherwiſe both theſe abſurdities ſhould follow, that this ſacrifice might be in vaine, and this wel-pleaſing might be changed: from whoſe righteouſneſſe ſo much is detracted, as we attribute either vnto cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ſelues, or thinke to attaine vnto, in reſpect of our owne ſatisfying: and againe, ſo much of Gods mercie is impaired, as we ſhall reſt vpon any power or vertue in our ſelues, whereby

Election is onely the Lords, therefore committed to no hazard: if on vs, who are like the wind in vnconſtancie, and as fraile as the tender hearbs, how ſoone ſhould all become nothing, therfore Gods decree being laid the <hi>firſt corner ſtone,</hi> we may aſſure our ſelues that the building ſhall ſtand for euer: therefore euery one in his conflicts with the deuill, hath full aſſurance of the conqueſt: for this roote is laid in him, whoſe fruit and branches ſtormy tempeſts may nippe and ſhake, yet the ſappe ſhal neuer be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp in the roote, neither ſhal any euil wind of Satan ſo blaſt, that the <hi>immortall ſeede</hi> bee at any time quite withered: yea, though all fierie darts bend thereto, with all might and maine employed: yet the ſtorme beeing blowne ouer by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace, and the comfortable ſunne of conſolation ſhining vpon our gloomy hearts, it will budde forth againe, into <hi>bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, fruit, and branch, as a most beautifull tree in the paradiſe of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let the compariſon of <hi>bodily ſickeneſſe,</hi> and the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the kind of frailtie mooue vs: we haue experience how diuers times the diſeaſe preuaileth ouer the ſicke perſons, that actions faile, and the faculties ſeeme quite to be ſpent; neither hand nor foote is able to doe their duties; the <hi>eie</hi> is dimme, the hearing dul, the <hi>taſt altered,</hi> and the <hi>tongue</hi> diſtaſteth all things, euen of moſt pleaſant reliſh; and the weake and feeble patient, ſeemeth to attend the time of diſſolution, when as yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding there remaineth a ſecret power of nature, and a forcible ſparke of life, that ouercometh all theſe infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and conſumeth them like droſſe, and rendreth to the body a greater purity, and firmeneſſe of health, then before the ſicknes it did enioy: euen ſo ought euerie one to eſteeme of the ſpirituall caſe, and conſider that their ſoule is ſicke but not dead, faith aſſailed but not ouercome: therefore let patience attend the finiſhing of this ſecret worke: and ſo ſhall they ſee theſe burning ſeauers of temptations, to be ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and cooled by the mercie and grace of Chriſt, and that ſparke of faith which did he hid, &amp; ouerwhelmed with heaps of temptations, to breake forth againe, conſume the cauſes of
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:21235:200"/>the diſeaſe. And as nature after a perfect criſe diſchargeth her ſelfe either by ſtoole, vomite, ſweat, bleeding, or ſuch like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacuations, to the recouery of the former health: euen ſo ſhall the faithful ſoule find in himſelfe ſtrange eaſe after theſe temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, by reaſon they haue cauſed diuers euacations of the filthines of ſinne, and therefore greater puritie muſt needs be in the ſoule. Thus the Lord <hi>preſerues the verie garments of his Saints, that he ſuffereth them not to take any ſmell of the flame,</hi> or the verie ſweat of afflictions to ſticke vpon them: Pſal. 68.22. <hi>The Lord hath ſaid I will bring my people againe from Baſhan: I will bring them againe from the depths of the ſea:</hi> Og the Gyant, and all his fat bulls may puſh at the godly, but their ſtrength ſhall not preuaile againſt the ſtrong one of Iſrael: but euen the foote of his faithfull ones ſhal be <hi>dipped in blood, and the tongues of the dogges of Iſrael may drawe</hi> out the verie heart blood of all theſe bulls: So that after the conqueſt, the triumph beeing gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Lord, they may truly celebrate it, ſetting <hi>the ſingers before, the players of inſtruments after:</hi> ſo that the <hi>praiſe of God may be heard in his aſſemblies,</hi> euen from all them that are <hi>deriued from the fountaine of Iſrael:</hi> ſo that this knot betwixt God &amp; the faithfull ſoule, more ſurely knit then that of <hi>Gordius,</hi> can neuer be looſed by the deuill, broken by his forces, diſanulled by his ſtratagemes, or euer found out by his policies. Therfore as Chriſt cried out, <hi>O my God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> it is impoſſible that Chriſt ſhould be forſaken, therefore it is a voice more for the inſtruction of his children, then to ſhew his owne diſcomforts: if he cried out, why may not we crie out? yet as Chriſt was heard, and freed from his feare; ſo ſhall euery faithfull ſoule be ſure to ſpeede with his God, and ſhall againe (as Dauid was) be reſtored to thoſe wonted ioyes, which they ſometimes felt in the ſweet mercies of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Theſe aſſaults are at the firſt heauie and bitter; if they come in great meaſure, they may cauſe impatience, Iob 3.1. if they continue, then may the ſoule beginne to iudge them nothing but Gods wrath: Iob 6.2, 3. <hi>The arrowes of the Almightie are in me, and the venome thereof doth drinke vp my ſpirit, and the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of God are againſt me:</hi> it brings afreſh his old ſinnes into
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:21235:201"/>remembrance, to trouble him in his ſleepe; viſions, dreames, and anxietie of ſpirit. Yet in this miſerie God ſupports his faith; he feeling this, gets experience, Rom. 5.4. hence hope, that grace ſhall neuer be wanting, Iob 42.5, 6, Heb. 12.11. Let Pharaoh feele but a little of this, and he preſently rebells: yet the faithfull, though they haue more feeling of their rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hearts, and the deuill more ſtrongly aſſailes them then any other, yea God ſeemes to be their enemie; yet, Iob 13.15. <hi>Though he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him.</hi> Dauid, Pſal. 22.1. O my God, I crie by day, but thou heareſt not; by night, but I haue no audience: words almoſt of deſperation, and as a man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith: yet then he ſaith, <hi>My God;</hi> a plaine argument of faith: for Gods children can not forget their language.</p>
                  <p>Hence a man may in a manner, ſee contrarie affections in their prayers: for fleſh and ſpirit ſtruggle together: Gen. 32.18. Iaakobs wraſtling is a type of the conflicts of the faithfull with Chriſt: he aſſailes them with the one hand, and vpholds them with the other: hence <hi>Iaakob</hi> is called <hi>Iſrael, a preuailer</hi> with God. The Church hath both his names, Pſal. 130. and Pſal. 121. Mark. 15.22. to 27. we ſee a ſtrange conflict be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the woman of Samaria and our Sauiour Chriſt: foure no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table repulſes are giuen her; 1. ſilence, 2. haiſh ſpeeches of the Diſciples, Send her away; 3. cold comfort, I am come for the houſe of Iſrael, of which thou art none; 4. extraordinarie reproch, Thou art but as a dogge; therefore muſt thou haue none of the childrens bread: yet we finde her to be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant at euery repulſe, and when the moſt dangerous repulſe was giuen her, to bring an inuincible argument of her faith, True Lord, I yeild all; if my place and deſeruings muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, then no mercie for me; but, Lord, yet account of me as thou haſt ſaide, let me thy dogge <hi>but taſt of the crummes of thy mercie,</hi> and it ſhall ſuffice the hunger of my ſoule. Thus Gods children ouerwhelmed with ſinne, turmoiled with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans conflicts, and amazed with Gods anger, can then lift vp their eye lids, and giue a glimps to the braſen ſerpent Chriſt Ieſus, and fling themſelues into his armes, catch hold on Gods hand buffetting them, and kiſſe it.</p>
                  <pb n="379" facs="tcp:21235:201"/>
                  <p> There be three grounds of temptation. Firſt, our <hi>naturall weakeneſſe,</hi> prooued by Sathan and the world. Secondly, the continuall <hi>buds of our originall ſinne;</hi> in vnderſtanding, will, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and all their inſtruments: our vnderſtanding is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into blindnes of error, our will embraceth not onely thoſe things which corrupt iudgement directeth vnto, but euen where vnderſtanding ſtandeth ſound; there will bendeth to affection, and neglecteth the light of reaſon: our affections are both rebellious to right iudgement and will; in that they rage when they ſhould not, and where iuſt cauſe is giuen, are quiet and at reſt. Thus from theſe principles in the ſoule, the bodily members become weapons and inſtruments of all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie and iniuſtice, euen to the ouerturning of Church and Common-wealth, except the Lord ſhould reſtraine them: in ſo much that the very pillars of the world would ſhatter in ſunder, and the vault of heauen would fall, &amp; all things would turne to their former Chaos, &amp; be conſumed with the terrible fire of Gods vengeance, and periſh in his heauie diſpleaſure. Thirdly, God puts on his children armour of proofe, but they are negligent in the buckling of it on them; and therefore the deuill often takes aduantage by that to doe vs hurt: euen the gifts and graces of God are made grounds of the deuils temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: and therefore no maruaile though Sathan and the world preuaile againſt vs, except the Lord ſtretch forth his hand and vphold vs. Therefore becauſe I ſee the point in hand waightie, and that which troubles the whole world to lie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vpon this foundation; and the reſolution whereof can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but adminiſter excellent comfort to euery Chriſtian, I wil be bold to inlarge my meditations: and the more willingly, becauſe it is ſo direct with my text, not as grounded from it, but as miſapplied of the weak Chriſtian, taking euery ſight of his ſin, for this <hi>fearefull ſetting of them before the eies of his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi> when the Lord onely threatneth the hypocrits and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of this world, which will not but by conſtraint of law and iudgement, meddle with their ſinnes: nay on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, it is their nature to make God alwaies a friend vnto them, as before we declared. Therefore for the godlies ſake, will I
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:21235:202"/>not keepe ſilence in proceeding for their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort. The grounds of all temptations beeing laid both inward and outward, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall and accidentall; we will come to the difficultie of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, to ſee how the deuill aimes at theſe grounds.</p>
                  <p>For diſtinction, he doth it two waies, either <hi>mediately</hi> or <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately:</hi> mediately either by ſingle <hi>means,</hi> or by ioyning <hi>two together:</hi> all theſe kinds will I manifeſt in the following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. And firſt, for his immediate working; the experience of it is more lamentable and infallible, then the manner howe eaſie to finde out: yet ſomething dare we boldly affirme, and for methods ſake, we bring it to two heads. It is either corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>poſſeſſion,</hi> or <hi>ſpirituall:</hi> for the firſt, hee may eaſily bring it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout without any meanes; becauſe he is a moſt ſubtile nature, and ful of ſtrength; by his ſubtiltie he may eaſily enter the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die; and by his ſtrength, he may carrie it at his pleaſure; he may poſſeſſe the whole bodie, &amp; as <hi>Maſter command all that houſe;</hi> but ſurely, hee can not haue ſuch acceſſe vnto the ſoule; yet from his nature beeing by creation a ſpirit, and therefore of the ſame kind of eſſence with our ſoules, and indued with the ſame <hi>qualities of vnderſtanding and will,</hi> is able by agreement of nature, and excellencie of qualitie to ouer-reach man, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſelfe ſame kind his inferiour: For the nature of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels is more excellent then mans: and therefore hath hee a power ouer them; for in nature euery inferiour power is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected to the ſuperiour, yet both of them limited of God. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I doubt not, but <hi>God permitting, the deuill</hi> is able to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with our ſpirits, without all corporall meanes; euen as we ſee corporall creatures with bodily and corporall force, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy one another; and as men haue fellowſhip one with other by corporall preſence, and are delighted or diſpleaſed with the qualities of the mind, according as they like or diſlike, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by <hi>ſpeach and talke:</hi> ſo it is moſt like that ſpirits haue their ſocietie maintained by a <hi>ſpirituall conference,</hi> whereby their wils and purpoſes are intercommunicated one to another, without corporall ſound, whereof both the ſpirits want the inſtrument, and the voice nothing affecteth the mind. Daily experience maketh this manifeſt in ſuch as are poſſeſſed; whoſe
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:21235:202"/>diſcourſes are often rare and admirable, whoſe ſpeach and phraſe is often ſuch as they neuer learned. Now the deuill muſt needs be the ſchoolemaſter; and ſurely he informes them not by voice, but by ſpirituall communication; and ſo they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a cleare notion, of many a point they were alwaies igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, and are able to expreſſe it in all varietie of languages, and that in the phraſe of eloquence: Nay, in a leſſer degree then all this, the falſe ſpirit perſwades Ahab by all his falſe and lying Prophets, that he ſhould goe vp and proſper: ſurely this ſpirit informed their ſpirits. Thus entred <hi>Satan into Iudas,</hi> not by corporall poſſeſſion, but ſpirituall; and perſwaded him to betray Chriſt: thus <hi>Ananias,</hi> Acts 5. <hi>had his heart filled:</hi> and Epheſ. 2. the deuill is called <hi>the ſpirit that worketh in the children of diſobedience:</hi> and that once they walked according to the conduct of that ſpirit. Theſe muſt needs bee reall operations, carrying a force in them, more then obiects do vnto any facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that is conuerſant about it: for ſuppoſe the deuill ſhould hold any art before the eies of an ignorant man, could he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly become a good Grammarian, Rhetorician, Logician; whereby hee would talke with a <hi>Grecian,</hi> though he were a <hi>Barbarian;</hi> plead with <hi>Cicero,</hi> though he were one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort; and diſpute with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> though he had neuer been in their ſchooles, but had followed the plough all his life? I ſhould from reaſon thinke it impoſſible: therefore he communicates his knowledg with theſe ignorant perſons. But you will ſay, this is ſtrange, why ſhould we then not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it? I anſwer, the bodie in which the ſoule is, is as a vayle, to hide his manner of communication from vs: yet it is no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance for him to enter within the vaile, and ſpeake vnto vs <hi>more angelico:</hi> yet we peceiue it not, ſaue in the effects; becauſe for the time of this life, we exerciſe all actions through the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: yet I am perſwaded, that if the ſoule were out of the body, we ſhould perceiue it moſt plainely: if the curtain were drawn we ſhould ſee the deuill lying with vs in our boſomes: for the ſoules among themſelues, and with the angels in heauen, haue ſweet communication, and therefore I feare not, but the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſoules and deuils in hell, haue their wofull ſocietie.</p>
                  <pb n="382" facs="tcp:21235:203"/>
                  <p> Againe, for the better conceiuing of this point, wee ſtand not only ſubiect to Sathans annoyance, through the ſubtilnes of his nature, being a ſpirit; but through that long experience and practiſe about our miſerie, from age to age, is able to work more powerfully, the Lord permitting him for a time. Thus more perfectly he knows our minds, and gathers much by the inclination of our affections, and will, and marking the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect on which we dwell. But you will obiect, the Lord hath reſerued this propertie vnto himſelfe to know the heart. <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is true; but the communication of the heart, may be betwixt man and man, and man and angels: therefore the Lord direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowes the heart, and all the corners of it; ſo that wee can bring no fallacian out of it to deceiue God; but the deuill may be deceiued, as ſurely often he is in the diſcourſes of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Experience hath prooued, that the conſultations of wicked kings, haue been reuealed to the godly, 2. kin. 6.11. <hi>Will ye not ſhewe me, which of vs bewrayeth our counſell to the King of Iſrael? one of his ſeruants makes anſwer, It is Eliſha the Prophet that tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the King of Iſrael, euen the words that thou ſpeakeſt in thy pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy chamber:</hi> Eliſha heard not theſe words, yet they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated vnto him after a ſpirituall manner, ſuch as are the viſions of God: and thus Paul, depriued of all bodily inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſawe things inutterable. Yea, the deuill beeing Gods ape, hath detected one wicked mans counſell to an other: but he hath alwaies bin deceiued in the conſultations of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and neuer was able to reueale them. To proceede: From this experience he can conclude not onely from our ſpeeches, and geſtures, to conceiue of our intents, and purpoſes; but out of our vniuerſall corruption, whereof hee hath continuall proofe, much matter of argument to diſcouer the vanitie of our minds, the ſecret thoughts of our hearts, and the verie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of the ſame. Now theſe beeing found out, hee will proceed to ſuggeſtion, as he ſeeth occaſion, and our greateſt inclination, and ſo by inſtigation vnto ſinne, make vs diſobey God, and all his holy commandements. Againe, that he doth not all by ſuggeſtion vnto the ſoule inclining it, is plaine, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our natures ſeem not to incline vnto them, in any ſpeciall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:21235:203"/>or loue it before other wickedneſſe; neither the world alluring or inforcing vs; eſpecially Gods children ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring the very leaſt conceit of ſuch ſinnes, as blaſphemies, and laying violent hands on themſelues, or others, without all hate or malice, or any occaſion of reuenge. And ſurely of the ſame nature, is deſpaire and diſtruſt of Gods mercies, loſſe of the ſeede of Gods word, when we haue no inclination vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them at all, but rather contrarily affected: and theſe the deuill puts vnto vs in regard of our generall corruption, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further conſideration of ſpeciall inclination; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he neuer ceaſeth in theſe temptations, becauſe he hath hope to preuaile in them; and therefore ſhall we neuer be rid of the deuil, vntill God haue wholly deliuered vs from our ſtaines. Truely Gods children often admire how euer ſuch a thought ſhould riſe in their head, when they hate the very appearance of it.</p>
                  <p>Now I come to the ſecond head, which is done by meanes, firſt ſingle, and then mixt: but before I enter this, let vs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the deuill as a <hi>fowler,</hi> whoſe nature is to be <hi>a friend in ſhew, but a foe in heart.</hi> Secondly, looke vpon his <hi>ſnares,</hi> which all of them haue three properties, <hi>ſweet, dangerous, ſecret.</hi> Thirdly, conſider the waies of his laying: the deuills way is ſuggeſtion, reall operation, and both together: the way wherein he layes them, is <hi>inward</hi> or <hi>outward;</hi> inward, <hi>iudgements</hi> and <hi>luſts;</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions, graces, things indifferent, and euill company as the ſtale: the hold that he hath, is very ſtrong, for vntill grace haue turned him out, he holds men at his will: a moſt <hi>beaſtly captiuitie:</hi> nay worſe then beaſtly, becauſe beaſts hauing once bin ſnared, wil come there no more; but a man is neuer wel but when he is in the ſnares of the deuil. Secondly, it is a <hi>voluntarie captiuitie,</hi> and therefore like to be for euer, except the Lord haue mercy to change his mind, and draw him againſt his wil. Thirdly, it is <hi>moſt baſe:</hi> for <hi>Iſrael in Egypt</hi> may be accounted kings in regard of the ſlaues of the deuill. Laſtly, it is <hi>moſt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous,</hi> becauſe they renounce their couenant with God, and ſtrike hands with the deuill; and therefore from theſe things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, we may make full account that the deuil hath many
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:21235:204"/>meanes to helpe him: the firſt is ſuggeſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on the ſoule, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with all the baits he can imagine: the ſecond reall ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration on the bodie, affecting humour and ſpirit, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them aſſiſt him as meanes to worke our woe. Humor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered, cauſeth diſeaſes to the bodie, and the bodie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed, changeth our manners and courſe of liuing: <hi>hinc mores ſequuntur humores.</hi> Againe, he dulls the ſpirits, and ſo cauſeth drouſineſſe in the worſhip of God, and euerie good calling: againe, he refreſheth them in euill, and therefore keepes vs long waking vnto it.</p>
                  <p>For the mixing of both together, both <hi>ſuggeſtion</hi> and <hi>real o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,</hi> the deuill can play his part moſt dangerouſly: for he can worke the humours of our bodies, to make notable way for ſuggeſtion vpon our ſoules. If a man bee of a <hi>melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie conſtitution,</hi> whoſe humour is <hi>drie</hi> and <hi>cold,</hi> the deuill will make it notably affect a man in all his members; eſpecially in his heart and braine, the two of the principall parts of man, and where the ſoule hath moſt reſidence: in the heart he will affect him with ſudden feares, ſtrange diſtruſts, ſuſpition of infinit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills; whereby he will mooue the ſoule in iudgement, will, and affection, to ſet about the inuenting, willing, and effecting of ſome ſtrange exploits, to eaſe himſelfe of his paines: hence of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten either murder of himſelfe, or of ſome other, which he falſly ſuſpects an inſtrument of his woe. Againe, the braine, by alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all the ſenſes, working ſtrange imaginations, by which it is almoſt impoſſible, but that the mind of man ſhould be ſet a working: and theſe being falſe grounds, hardly ſhal the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eſcape vncorrupted: nay alas, whatſoeuer they conceit vpon theſe grounds, ſhall not be remoued out of their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They that thinke themſelues to be <hi>made of glaſſe,</hi> wil not ſuffer their verie freinds to come neere them: he that thought himſelfe to <hi>be a cocke,</hi> would neuer giue ouer the ſpreading of his armes, in imitation of the cocke clapping his wings, and then would endeuour to imitate the cockes crow: he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited himſelfe to be Atlas, could neuer be brought to ſit down, leſt his head that vnderpropped heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being remoued, ſhould ſuffer heauen to fall vpon him: he that thought a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:21235:204"/>tyrant had cut off his head, could neuer be perſwaded to the contrary, vntill his head aked, the phyſitian hauing put a cap of lead on it. The woman that imagined that ſhe had ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a Serpent, could neuer be at reſt vntill ſhe ſawe one priuily conueied into her ſtoole, which ſhe imagined to haue beene brought downe by the phyſitians purgation. Another thinking himſelfe dead would eat no meat, becauſe it was not vſuall for dead men to eate, vntill he ſawe one come out of a ſheete and at the table before him fall vnto his meat. Now as it fares with the bodie, ſo may the deuill cauſe it fal out with the ſoule; make men co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit ſtrange things either by preſumption, as theſe hypocrites, that they were like God, that all was well with them; or by deſpaire to diſcourage themſelues, that they are out of the loue and fauour of God, and therefore neuer hope for any mercie; therefore good to make a ſudden di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch of themſelues by death: and therefore Serapio calls this humour, the very ſeate of the deuill: and our common ſpeech is, that melancholy is the deuils blacke horſe.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if a man be of a <hi>cholerick complexion, hote</hi> and <hi>drie,</hi> it makes him fit for anger, contention, and brawling; the deuill will augement it, and make him forget all reaſon &amp; humanity, and like beaſts kill one another: if a man be of a <hi>ſanguine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, hote</hi> and <hi>moiſt,</hi> then naturally they are merry and Iovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſpoſed: therefore he ſtirres theſe perſons to wantonnes, &amp; vncleannes: if of a <hi>phlegmaticke conſtitution,</hi> which is <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>moiſt,</hi> then they are heauie and ſleepie, and theſe the deuill wil notably aſſaile with all manner of idleneſſe, the begetter of all manner of vices. Againe, he can play his part with the ſpirits of the body, which are moſt excellent, and the verie bonds of our ſoule and bodie. Firſt, with the natural ſpirits, he can helpe forward to great vices: gluttonie and drunkenneſſe, make men paſſe all bonds of ſobrietie, therefore by the naturall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits he will notably increaſe the deſire of all drunkards and gluttonous liuers. It is an admirable thing to conſider, what many witches wil deuoure, &amp; yet ſay they haue eaten nothing. By this meanes the deuill keeps men from all good callings, and diſpoſeth them vnto all euill. Secondly, for the vitall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:21235:205"/>he can make men liuely, quicke, &amp; nimble to runne about his matters; and againe make them dead hearted when they would goe about the workes God requires: and therefore no maruell why men are ſo chearefull at playes, beare-baitings, laſciuious dauncing, and many wicked recreations; when at ſermons, and works of their callings, they thinke euery houre a day, and euerie day a yeare. Thirdly, for the animall ſpirits: he makes what he lift of our outward ſenſes: he hath the <hi>eye</hi> at command to behold vanitie; the <hi>eare</hi> at his becke to liſten vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to lies; the <hi>tongue</hi> at will to blaſpheme God; the <hi>hand</hi> at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to ſhed blood; and the <hi>feete</hi> vnfettered to runne into all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of riot: he hath the <hi>ſmell</hi> to wind a commoditie, though it muſt be gotten by oppreſſion; he hath the <hi>touch</hi> moſt exquiſite to finger other mens goods, but as tender as butter to receiue any iniury. For the inward ſenſes, he hath the <hi>common-ſenſe,</hi> the very ſinke and puddle where all the outward ſenſes cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelues, that a ſpeedie conueyance may be made to the <hi>phanſie,</hi> and ſo to the iudgement, will, and affections, that ſinne may euen haue entertainment without all intreatie, &amp; quicke diſpatch in his buſines without all controlment or contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: the <hi>memorie</hi> in good caſe, to become a ſtore houſe for all villanie; and the <hi>phanſie</hi> night nor day to be at reſt, vntill they haue found out a tabernacle for the deuill with all his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to dwell in. Theſe ſpirits helpe forward all motions, and ſurely the deuill hee will driue the cart and horſes: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no maruell if we ruſh into ſinne as the <hi>horſe doth into the battell:</hi> for he goes faſt enough whome the deuill driueth: and therefore ſeeing that the deuill hath ſo many waies to deale with vs, no extraordinarie matter to be troubled with him: and as he driues vs vnto ſinne, ſo would he likewiſe driue vs into ſetting ſinnes before our eyes, eſpecially when the hand of God is vpon body or ſoule, to deſpaire of his mercie, and leaue off all our confidence, and cry nothing but reprobation: let vs a litle ſee this cheife aduerſarie of our ſoule, that we may the better oppoſe him.</p>

                     </gap>, to ſignifie vnto vs great knowledge. Sixe thouſand yeares, in a manner, is the time of his age, which were able to make one wiſe, that were by nature ſimple and fooliſh; therefore much more one of an exquiſite knowledge by nature: he is a ſpirituall beeing, and ſo is able to diue as it were into the ſecrets of nature, and with incredible ſwiftnes to paſſe from plece to place, readie to intrude himſelfe into all companies, and learne their natures, qualities, diſpoſitions and order of life: ſo that our eſtate is almoſt vnto Sathan, as was that of the king of Arams, 2. kin. 6.12. <hi>he knoweth all our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and conſultations, which wee take and hold in our moſt ſecret chambers:</hi> for indeed for the moſt part, he is the cheife coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller in all matters of ſinne; and receiues ſuch intelligence fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our <hi>cogitations, affections, luſts, inclinations,</hi> and outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that he can ſhrewdly geſſe at the frame of the ſoule, if he keepe vs companie but a few dayes: by the abuſe of ſimple in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, he can teach vs how to inuent much euil: by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of <hi>ſcience,</hi> he can become a <hi>lying ſpirit in the hearts of all men,</hi> to ſeduce them to all error and hereſie: by the euill <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe</hi> of <hi>wiſedome,</hi> he can drawe men from one danger to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and perſwade them that all are true diductions; for yeeld to one ſinne, and a thouſnad will follow out of the deuils diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes: by the diſorder of <hi>prudence,</hi> he can teach men that no practiſe is warrantable, but that which followes their method; and by the euill handling of <hi>art,</hi> he can ſeeme to be skilfull, by
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:21235:206"/>nayling men faſt vnto all their impieties.</p>
                  <p>Hence ariſe all the deuills ſtratagems: firſt, againſt <hi>vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;</hi> 2. the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>affections;</hi> 3. the <hi>body.</hi> Againſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; firſt, he deſires nothing more then to put out that eie, and make men like mill horſes, to runne round in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and when he pleaſeth may ſuffer them to knock out their braines. Secondly, after he hath blinded the mind with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, then he tempts them to error: and thirdly, from error he brings them to hereſie, and from hereſie hee leads them a long to hardneſſe of heart; from hardneſſe of heart, to no ſenſe and feeling of their wretched eſtate, and then follows all wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe, vncleanneſſe, vnto which they giue themſelues with greedineſſe: Epheſ. 4.17. <hi>vanitie of mind,</hi> brings in <hi>darkeneſſe of cogitation;</hi> darkenes of cogitation, <hi>eſtrangeth a man from the life of God:</hi> ſtrangers we are with God <hi>through ignorance,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially becauſe of the hardneſſe <hi>of our hearts,</hi> this drawes on a ſenſeleſſe conſcience, &amp;c. Theſe ſtratagems are moſt naturall to all, and vpon theſe he builds the reſt: firſt <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> that there is no God: ſecondly, vpon that he laies a ſecond, that then there is no worſhip of God: thirdly, that then there is no <hi>word of God:</hi> fourthly, that then a man is not to beleeue that which is preached. Hence all the myſterie of a mans faluation, is to wicked men nothing but fooliſhnes: thus he brings men to forſake God, renounce their baptiſme, and giue themſelues wholly to his ſeruice.</p>
                  <p>After the deuil hath thus hammered the vnderſtanding, and beaten it out to his owne will and bent, he ſets vpon the will and affections of men, and knowing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to wheele in a wrong courſe from God, he labours againſt nothing more, then that they ſhould euer liſten vnto any meanes, that might bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againe to run in the waies of God. Firſt therfoere, hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades them, to beleeue that the <hi>word of God is not true:</hi> this he did to our firſt parents, Gen. 3. if he cannot perſwade this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe now it hath beene confirmed by ſo many miracles, and ſhedding of ſo much blood, that euen natural men may as wel as deuils, <hi>beleeue it to be true, and tremble.</hi> Yet he hath a ſecond courſe, that though they beleeue this word, yet that faith is
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:21235:206"/>either meerely <hi>hiſtoricall,</hi> or elſe indeede meere preſumption; in which faith millions of ſoules goe to hell. But if he ſee that the ſoule will not preſume, then he perſwades the difficultie <hi>of faith,</hi> that it is a verie hard matter to beleeue, and thouſands that ſtriue for it goe without; therefore as good ſit ſtill, as ſtriue and be neuer the better. Others againe are perſwaded, that ſuch a doe for faith is a needleſſe thing; they can content themſelues with an ordinarie perſwaſion of Gods mercy, and to looke for higher myſteries belongs to their teachers, and not to them; theſe will neuer trie whether they beleeue or no, but will bee content with ſuch as God ſends them. Another fort are tempted to thinke, that the name of a beleeuer is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit vnto them, and therefore they will neuer be pointed at as ſingular. A ſixt kind are tempted with their vnworthines: how can the Lord beſtowe ſuch an excellent grace vpon mee that am ſo vnworthy? A ſeuenth ſort are tempted with the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoundneſſe of their faith, becauſe they ſee many imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Eightly, others that they haue no faith, becauſe no fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Ninth, that their faith may fall as Iudas faith did. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they can neuer withſtand all theſe tempeſts, that break in vpon them: By all theſe meanes the deuill labours to drawe the will to infidelitie; after this he allures the wil by large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſes to beleeue in him, and ſo brings a miſerable ſlauerie vpon the will.</p>
                  <p>The affections are mooued and tempted of the deuil by the baites of proſperitie, or els diſquieted with aduerſitie to curſe Gods prouidence, &amp;c. The body in ſpirit, humour, tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, qualitie, inſtrument, and ſubſtance, is notably tempted, and wrought vpon by the deuill. Many points might here be cleared, and examples for the illuſtration of them; I will giue one that I haue ſeene by late experience, who inclining to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation of his braine, and ſo vnto aphrenſie, was tempted to murther himſelfe; and that with this ſtrong perſwaſion of his phanſie, that except hee did it ſpeedily, a thouſand deaths worſe then that would befall him; which thing beeing falſly apprehended of him, made him preſently yeeld; and hauing hung vp himſelfe by both his garters vpon a tree, his garters
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:21235:207"/>preſently broke; a woman that was weeding in a garden bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not farre from him, the deuil perſwaded him that ſhee had cut his garters; and without all queſtion, if he had not beene preuented, when he was come complaining vnto the woman what an iniurie ſhe had done him, would preſently for that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, haue beene tempted to kill the woman: His phrenſie growing vpon him, and making him ſo vnruly, that they were faine to bind him with ropes, &amp; two or three men watch him, and then his phanſie apprehending, that euery man he ſawe, or any creature that came in his ſight, was come to kill him, he would alwaies crie, <hi>If I had beene hanged, I ſhould neuer haue beene thus miſuſed.</hi> The like hath beene in many others, that when they haue beene about to make away themſelues for ſome diſtempered humour, haue alſo plotted to kill wife and children, not for that they hated them, but that they ſhould not liue in diſagrace after their death. All this and much more can the deuill doe by his great wit and vnderſtanding.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps you will ſay, he is not ſo <hi>malciouſly bent</hi> for his will. I anſwer, that as he hath vnderſtanding to doe euill, ſo he hath a will to do more then he can inuent or imagine with his minde. See then the degrees of his malitious will againſt mankind: Firſt, if we could finde in our cowardly hearts to ſue for a diſhourable peace with the deuill, Gods and our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, there ſhould be no hope of truce or reconciliation with him: for his malice is not newly conceiued, but inueterate; and as auncient within a fewe dayes, as the world it ſelfe, and for time to come, it is endleſſe and will outlaſt the world. He was almoſt burſt with enuie againſt <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, and ſo is he in like manner againſt all that are raiſed vp againe in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Adam, and haue gotten the <hi>fee ſimple</hi> of euerlaſting glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Gods proclamation of open warres, Gen. 3.15. is not yet come to an ende, but is to laſt for euer. Thus then you ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice without all reconciliation, auncient and endleſſe; but yet a fourth degree followes, and that is, that his malice is mortall and deadly, not to a mans goods and poſſeſſions, or body or bodily life, but to body and ſoule, whoſe deſtruction is a paradiſe of ioy vnto him: therefore is he called <hi>Satan,</hi> Zac.
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:21235:207"/>3.1. <hi>an enemie:</hi> Matth. 13.39. <hi>a malitious one.</hi> Neither is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this enemie to be ſatisfied with ſome ſmall reuenge, for he is called a <hi>murtherer,</hi> and a <hi>manſlayer,</hi> as though it were his onely occupation: neither is he of late fallen to this trade, for he hath profeſſed it from the beginning, like an old hangman, he is fleſht in blood and crueltie.</p>
                  <p>But it may be a ſauage man may haue in him ſome reliques of humanitie, and therefore the deuill hauing reaſon as well as man, may ſometimes recall himſelfe by reaſon, and take ſome pitie: but the Scriptures driues vs from this conceit, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him vnto the moſt cruell beaſts; firſt a lyon, yea a <hi>roaring lyon after his pray,</hi> who being ſo hungry and rauenous, that he deſireth nothing more then to ſeaze vpon that which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth, 1. Pet. 5.8. Secondly, that yet we may a little the more conceiue of his brutiſh cruelitie, he is compared, Reu. 12.3. to <hi>a red dragon,</hi> whoſe fiercenes we find in hiſtory to exceede all lyons: for a lyon if he be not hungry, and ſee one not oppoſe him, but fall downe before him, will not hurt him: but a dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon will deuoure mans fleſh for ſport.</p>
                  <p>This malice is open, and ſo leſſe dangerous; but if he ſee that we are ſtrongly fortified with Gods grace, and at all points armed with compleat armour of a Chriſtian; if <hi>fenced and hedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on all ſides,</hi> as Iob was, Iob 1.10. then leauing his raging vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, he ſtriues with vs by fawning and alluring vs to ſinne: thus with our firſt parents, to taſt of that pleaſant fruit, which depriued them of the breaſt-plate of righteouſnes, and vnco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered them of Gods protection, ſo that euer ſince that time he hath had full blowes without all reſiſtance: hence he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a tempter, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that tempter, the tempter of tempters: after temptation, he falls to accuſation; hence he is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the deuill: after accuſation, he is very glad that God will any where make him an executioner and hang-man: his will then can be no leſſe then maliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it ſelfe, Eph. 6.12.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, though his will be malitiouſly bent, yet he wants ſtrength: but let me tell you, that the deuill is very ſtrong, both <hi>in himſelfe</hi> and in <hi>his aides.</hi> In himſelfe, he can
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:21235:208"/>raiſe great tempeſts, both by ſea and by land: he is compared to the <hi>great Leuiathan that makes the ſea to boyle with his moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> as ſtrong vpon earth as a lyon, <hi>a dragon with ſeuen heads, and tenne hornes, and with his very taile he throwes to the ground the third part of the ſtarres of heauen.</hi> Luk. 11.21. <hi>a ſtrong armed man, who keepeth in peace all that he poſſeſſeth:</hi> nay, a mightie prince, not of one country or land; but a monarch of the whole world, Ioh. 12.31. and by his authoritie, can command infinit multitudes to goe for him: neither is this all, but they bee called <hi>princes, powers, worldly gouernours,</hi> Epheſ. 6.12. and that theſe may not be one againſt another, they haue a head vnder which they all conſpired; Math. 25.41. <hi>fire prepared for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and his angels:</hi> in this ſenſe he is called Beelzebub, the prince of deuils: the word ſignifies a prince of flies, not for their weakneſſe, but mulitudes; euen as though they were ſwarmes conioyned together to do miſcheife; one ſpirit ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſeuen more, Mat. 12.45. nay a legion of deuils are ſpoken of, Luk. 8.30. ſo that they are a ſufficient number, to beſet vs all, on all ſides, and in all places.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, to ſet forth the aduantage he hath of vs poore men, they are ſaid to be <hi>princes of darkeneſſe;</hi> and that is lamentable, to fight with an enemy that can ſee vs, but not be ſeen againe. Secondly, they are not <hi>enemies of fleſh,</hi> but <hi>ſpirituall wickedneſſes;</hi> moſt dangerous, becauſe ſpirits; and peſtelent, becauſe no leſſe then wickedneſſe it ſelfe; they wil be with vs, becauſe they are ſo ſwift, and they neuer come without the plague and peſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of ſinne hanging about them. Thirdly, they haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the vpper ground, and fight from <hi>higher places</hi> then wee can reach vnto, being poore <hi>ſilly worms crawling vpon the earth:</hi> and the Scriptures truely laying open his ſtrength, call him no leſſe then a <hi>god of this world,</hi> 2. Cor. 4.4. as though he were om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent vpon earth. But perhaps you will ſay, he wants cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to his ſtrength: but let me tell you, I find him in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be no leſſe then exceeding deſperate, and audacious: there was neuer man that liued, but he had ſome thing to ſay with him: Adam in paradiſe; yea our ſauiour Chriſt; nay, Reu. 12.7. there is mention of a battell in heauen; <hi>Michael and his
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:21235:208"/>angels fought againſt the dragon, &amp; the dragon and his angels, &amp;c.</hi> But if I ſhould proceed, I ſhould vtterly diſ-hearten the poore Chriſtian, and make him deſpaire of any encounter, and hope of victorie; yet dare I boldly giue the deuill his aids, and yet bid the weakeſt Chriſtian offer the deuill his challenge: his aids are two; firſt the world, ſecondly his own fleſh; the one playes on both hands, with proſperity and aduerſitie; and the other a traytour, alwaies readie to betray him into the hands of his enemies.</p>
                  <p>Hauing deſcribed the deuill in his <hi>wit, will,</hi> and <hi>power;</hi> let vs ſee if there be any wiſdom to oppoſe him; any wil that exceeds as much in goodneſſe vnto man, as the deuill doth in malice; &amp; any power that can maſter the deuils. For the firſt, the good angels haue more wit then the bad, and yet their wiſedome is nothing vnto Gods: now <hi>the eye of the Lord is on the righteous,</hi> and all <hi>the holy angels pitch their tents about them:</hi> and therefore this counſel ſhall ſtand againſt all the policies of the deuil, and the <hi>gates of hell ſhal neuer preuaile.</hi> And for the vertues of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, God hath <hi>intelligence,</hi> to croſſe all the inuentions of the deuill; <hi>ſcience,</hi> to preſerue his owne truth from the lies of the deuill; <hi>ſapience,</hi> to drawe more good out of euill, then the deuill can euill out of good; and for <hi>prudence,</hi> God can order all that, which he hath laboured to bring to confuſion; and for <hi>arte,</hi> the Lord hath more skill to tye his owne vnto himſelfe, then the deuil hath to draw them from him: and for all thoſe ſtratagems wrought vpon the vnderſtanding, the Lord can take away the vaile of ignorance; preſerue from error, hardnes of heart, or any thing that might riſe out of that head. And for wil, and affection, and the whole body, the Lord hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed and will performe, that his holy ones ſhall be <hi>ſanctified throughout, both in body and ſoule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the malice of the deuills will, we ought to lay to heart the good will and pleaſure of our God, which hath ſaid, he wil not forſake vs: and for power, we may be aſſured that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill hath no power, but that which God ſhal permit vnto him: he cannot touch <hi>Iob,</hi> vntill God giue him leaue; he cannot be a meanes of <hi>Ahabs</hi> ruine, vntill it pleaſe God to yeild him that
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:21235:209"/>liberty, that <hi>he may be a lying ſpirit in the mouth of all his falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets:</hi> nay, he cannot enter ſo much as into ſuch creatures as ſwine, vntill Chriſt haue giuen him ſo much refreſhment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time of his wofull torture. Secondly, wee may fight with courage; for the deuill is alreadie chained, and reſerued to more ſtrong chaines hereafter: Iud. v. 6. Thirdly, God hath left vs ſuch ſtore of armour of proofe, as the deuill can neuer ſtrike through; hee may as eaſily wound God, as wound vs being couered with it: he can neuer looſe our <hi>girdle of veritie,</hi> ſtrike through our <hi>breaſt-plate of righteouſnes,</hi> vncouer our feet <hi>beeing ſhod with the preparation of the Goſpel of peace;</hi> his blowes can neuer enter the <hi>ſheild of faith,</hi> nor fierie darts peirce the ſoule, or drie vp the waters of the ſpirit; but faith hath ſuch a riuer flowing vp and downe the ſoule to eternall life, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery dart, be it neuer ſo red and ſcalding hote, is preſently quenched. The <hi>helmet of ſaluation</hi> wil be ſure to ſaue the head, for which the hand would be content to be cut off, before it ſhould receiue the leaſt blow; therefore the head beeing free, we need leſſe to feare the danger: and for our hands, we haue <hi>the ſword of the ſpirit,</hi> which is the onely weapon that the deuill may not endure: buckle on this armour by prayer and watchfulnes, and ſtill looke the deuil in the face, and we ſhall neuer receiue hurt by him: but if we turne back, then ſhall we haue not any peice of armour to ſaue vs from danger. They are princes, but we haue the <hi>Prince of peace,</hi> and angels their ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, and I doubt not but as many in number as they to fight for vs; and theſe haue gotten the vpper ground of the deuills: and for ſpirituall wickedneſſe, we haue gotten the ſpirit of grace and goodnes, that can mooue ſwifter then the deuils, to ſtand by vs, and <hi>aſſiſt vs in all our infirmities:</hi> let them all make vp a god in this world, yet he that rules heauen and earth will laugh them to ſcorne: truſt therefore in Gods power, and his aids, and be quiet a little, and theſe enemies that you ſee and feele in this world; yee ſhall neuer ſee them, or haue cauſe to ſeele them hereafter. The three children, Dan. 3. tell the King, they care not for his command: and why? becauſe they know that <hi>the God whom they-ſerue, can deliuer them; and if he will not,</hi>
                     <pb n="395" facs="tcp:21235:209"/>death ſhall be as good to them. Chriſt ſaies, <hi>his ſheepe heare his voice,</hi> and follow him, &amp; none ſhal take them out of his hands; the reaſon is, becauſe <hi>God that gaue them him, is ſtronger then all:</hi> Be of good comfort little children, yee haue ouercome the world: <hi>becauſe he that is in you, is ſtronger then he that is in the world,</hi> 1. Ioh. 4.4. The leper cries, <hi>if thou willt, thou canſt make me cleane:</hi> many be our leproſies, and happie are we that we haue ſo good a remedy. We pray for many ſtrange things, but if we obſerue but the concluſion of the Lords prayer, we may ſoone gather vp our ſpirits; ſeeing we knowe that power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs vnto God, <hi>thine is the kingdome, power, and glory.</hi> We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue a reſurrection, and many other ſtrange things; but our <hi>faith needs not to fall,</hi> ſeeing we ſay and beleeue that God is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, <hi>I beleeue in God the Father almightie:</hi> this made Paul to challenge principalities and powers, height and depth, &amp;c. Rom. 8. neuer had he the leaſt feare, that they ſhould euer be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>ſeparate him from the loue of God in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let vs ſee what comforts in ſpeciall, may be giuen to Gods children in affliction: for ſurely euery ſoule ſhall find with E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijah, 1. kin. 19. fleeing from Iezebel, comfort from the verie angels of God: yea when they are brought to ſtand <hi>vpon the mount before the Lord,</hi> they ſhall ſee the Lord paſſe by, and a <hi>mightie ſtrong wind rend the mountaines, and breake the rocks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, but the Lord was not in the winds:</hi> and after the wind <hi>came an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake: after the earthquake came fire, but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire, came a ſtill and foft voyce; and in that was the Lord found:</hi> Oh the goodneſſe of the Lord, that in all the winds, earthquakes, and fires, that he makes to paſſe before his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, will not be ſeene in them! for then ſhould euery one of vs be conſumed, and vtterly confounded; yet will he be found in the ſtill and ſoft voyce. It is an vſuall cuſtome, before great Potentates come vnto their palaces, to haue a peale of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to be ſhot off before their approach: ſo the Lord by this feare makes way, <hi>that the King of glorie may come in, and dwell with the ſoule.</hi> God hath diuerſe meanes to bring vp his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, lawe and goſpel, iudgement and mercie: in the giuing
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:21235:210"/>of the lawe, there was thunder, lightning, and earth quakes; yet the Lord was heard in a ſtil voice to deliuer his law. Gods ſchollers muſt ſtand as well at the foote of mount <hi>Ebor,</hi> to heare the curſe, as at mount <hi>Geriſon,</hi> to heare the bleſſings: the one prepares, the other enters more eaſily, to giue the heart her due comfort; Moſes, Deuter. 28. is full of curſes and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings: God hath many a good Dauid to rule ouer his people, as wel as hard hearted Pharaoh to ſchoole them; he hath more good Prophets to bleſſe them, then wicked Balaams to curſe them; he hath an <hi>euangelicall Iſaiah,</hi> to lift them vp with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Goſpel, as a lamenting <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> to caſt them downe with woes and lamentations: he hath an <hi>Hoſea</hi> and <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah</hi> to teach them in <hi>Enigmaes,</hi> and darke ſentences, and many other to bee as plaine as heart can wiſh: he hath many a Paul, <hi>I beſeech you brethren;</hi> as wel as ſons of thunder, to make vs quake and tremble: yea, and alwaies this is the ende of all afflictions, a gracious <hi>ſufficit:</hi> 2. Sam. 24.16. it is ſufficient, hold now thy hand. Now what the Lord doth either in proſperity or aduerſitie, often wee ſee not; and therefore we looſe the comfort of it. The birth of an infant, borne and encreaſing, is not apprehended preſently: euen ſo is it with vs in our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly birth, &amp; ſpirituall regeneration; the ſpirit worketh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our leaue, and acquainteth vs not with his maruailous working more then is expedient at his pleaſure, when and in what meaſure for our comfort. Therefore let vs take heed that God ſay not vnto vs as he did vnto Iob, cap. 38.2. who is this that darkeneth the counſell by words without knowledge? who are you that interrupt the wayes of God, and labour to preuent his counſels? be ſober and patient, and you ſhal in the ende receiue the cuppe of ſaluation, inſtead of theſe bottles of vineger and teares; and in ſtead of the bread of affliction, the heauenly manna, and the bread of life from the table of God, and of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time I commend vnto euerie ſoule in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe heads of comfort, which I will ſhewe vnto him in all the cauſes: Firſt, in the efficient cauſes; principall, leſſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall: Principall; firſt the promiſe of God, 1. Cor. 10.13. <hi>God is
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:21235:210"/>faithfull, therefore will he ſuffer no temptation to be aboue our abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but will euen giue the iſſue with the temptation, that we may be able to beare it.</hi> Secondly, his promiſe is grounded vpon his power: Col. 1.11. <hi>Strengthened with all might, through his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious power, vnto all patience and long-ſuffering with ioyfulneſſe:</hi> which power is manifeſted in thoſe two things, which grounds the confidence of al in the world, and that is, that the promiſer bee a man of ſufficiencie, and will alſo effect that which he hath promiſed: the firſt makes it poſſible in the thing; the ſecond makes it to exiſt in me: now wee ſhall finde both theſe in the Lord; which indeede grounds our faith in all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. But here is neede of particular application, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhall finde them both applyed vnto affliction: I may well beleeue God with eaſe in proſperitie; but <hi>hoc opus, hic la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor eſt,</hi> this is paine and toyle to beleeue in affliction: marke then theſe two places; firſt, for Gods ſufficiencie, 2. Cor. 12.9. <hi>my grace is ſufficient for thee:</hi> ſecondly, for Gods efficiencie, Iſa. 43.2. <hi>when thou paſſeſt through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the floods, that they doe not ouerflowe thee: when thou walkeſt thorough the verie fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt, neither ſhal the flame kindle vpon thee.</hi> This is more manifeſted in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of working; firſt, in the Father, becauſe of his relation; a father can do nothing which ſhall not be for the good of his ſonnes: Heb. 12.5. in affliction he ſpeakes as vnto children, <hi>my ſonne deſpiſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neither faint when thou art rebuked of him.</hi> Hence all is in loue, Heb. 12.6. <hi>Whom he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth euerie ſonne that hee receiueth:</hi> ſecondly, this loue muſt purge vs, Ioh. 15.2. <hi>Euery one that beareth fruit, hee purgeth that it may bring forth more fruit:</hi> for when we beginne to grow wild, he correcteth our haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and cooles our courage by ſome affliction or other, to cut ſhort our hornes, leaſt we like <hi>bulls of Baſhan,</hi> ſhould puſh at the godly: the Lord ſends fire, theeues, oppreſſion, to let vs blood in our riches, leaſt we ſhould be too ranke, and grow into a ſurfet. Hence we may gather, that the Lord hath means to ſaue vs, and giue vs conſolation in his good time, 2. Cor. 1.4. ſo that this cannot be in wrath, Pſal. 39.5. and therefore the
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:21235:211"/>Father doing this, it muſt needs returne vnto our good, Heb. 12.10.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond manner of working, is in regard of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus: for afflictions are indeed curſes, but Chriſt became a curſe for vs; and ſo as by ſinne bleſſings became curſes, ſo by Chriſt curſes became bleſſings: therefore the Apoſtle calls it, a gift, a matter of Gods liberalitie to become a ſufferer: Phil. 1.29. <hi>for vnto you it is giuen for Chriſt, that not onely ye ſhould beleeue in him, but alſo ſuffer for his ſake:</hi> as though it were a greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of commendation to ſuffer, then beleeue: hence Paul can be content in all eſtates, Phil. 4.13. The third manner of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king is, in regard of the holy Ghoſt, who is the comfortet of the faithfull, and therefore ſhall they be ſure to want no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; this makes the bodily abſence of Chriſt, better then his preſence, Ioh. 16.7.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the principall cauſes, able to ſupport the ſoule without any more: yet God is rich in comfort; for the leſſe principall cauſes are waightie, and more readie at hand; as firſt the word of God, with the miniſterie thereof: Afflictions worke beſt in men when they come with the word; <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> was more humbled by the ſpeech of <hi>Iehu</hi> the ſeer, then he was beeing compaſſed about with an hoſt of enemies. Adde wee vnto theſe the graces of Gods ſpirit in the hearts of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: we muſt ouercome griefe with patience, and eate out and burne out the temptation by faith, and purge diſtruſt in Gods promiſes by perſeuerance in prayer: Griefe naturally is heauie, and lies as lead at the heart, and conſequently preſſeth vs downeward, ſo that faith and praier, muſt keepe the heart and hands, the voyce and eyes vpward: if we can call, it ſhewes we are children of hope, hanging at the breaſt; for grace is like the ſtone that <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> put vnder <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he might ſit vpon it; and the exerciſe of it is as <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur,</hi> holding vp Moſes weake hands; which while they are ſteadie, make <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael preuaile againſt the Amalakites:</hi> but when they ſhrinke downe, Amalek preuailes: Euen ſo is it with Chriſtians, they ſit vpon the corner ſtone Chriſt Ieſus, but their hands and knees fainting in the exerciſes of prayer, and other graces of
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:21235:211"/>Gods ſpirit, makes the deuill our curſed Amalek preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs: but the Lord will neuer leaue vs without good <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi> and <hi>Hurs,</hi> to helpe to ſtay vp our hands, vntill the going downe of the ſunne, and then ſhall Amalck vtterly be diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited.</p>
                  <p>More ſpecially I bring a threefold combination of grace, with one ſingle, to runne through euerie one of them. The firſt combination is of <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>conſcience:</hi> knowledge, 2. Tim. 1.12. <hi>I am not aſhamed, becauſe I know who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I haue beleeued:</hi> ſecondly conſcience, which is a continuall feaſt; &amp; therfore he that hath a good conſcience, may alwaies keepe a good houſe, and be a cheerfull man all the dayes of his life. The ſecond combination is prayer &amp; faith; praier as a watchword ſtirs vp in the ſoule, and muſters vp together an army of heauenly ſouldiers; yea and God the cheife generall to ſend preſent aid to beat backe all the force of the enemie, and all of them fall backward; euen as the great multitude that came to take our Sauiour Chriſt. Againe, faith ſtaies the hand of God continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: it is a moſt ſure ſtancher of blood; ſo that if any affliction lie vpon vs, it is for want of faith. <hi>Moſes</hi> was rebuked of the Lord for the not circumciſing of his ſonne, his faith was weake, and his wife in performing that duty was almoſt without faith: yet the Lord departed away, and ſpared both.</p>
                  <p>Third combination is <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>wiſedome:</hi> Patience, Luk. 21.19. <hi>by your patience poſſeſſe your ſoules:</hi> the ſeruice and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God in affliction, is patience: now wiſedome is moſt excellent, for it teacheth vs to deſcend downe into our owne ſoules, and plead guiltie; but there it leaues vs not, as fooliſh perſons, to lie pleading with the iaylor or hangman for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; but preſently brings vs vp againe, and maketh vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend vnto the Iudge in heauen, with a pardon receiued at the hands of his Sonne to intreat for mercie, and that with full aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, becauſe in the pardon the grant is ſpecified which the Lord will neuer forget: This makes vs ſee the true cauſe of our miſerie: 2. Sam. 6.16. <hi>what haue I to doe with you yee ſonnes of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia; hee curſeth euen becauſe the Lord hath bidden him curſe Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid; who dare then ſay, wherefore haſt thou done it?</hi> thus our wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:21235:212"/>teacheth vs to ſee the cauſe, and then looke to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and conſider that his hand is not a deſtroying hand, but a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. A man that falls into ſickneſſe, if it come whileſt he is in his calling, he is then leſſe greiued, then if he ſhould haue brought it vpon him by ſurfeting, and haue hatched it by his ill courfes: euen ſo it comes to paſſe in the ſickneſſes of the ſoule; If I was vſing the meanes of godlines in ſinceritie of heart, then ſhall I be aſſured that all this is either to free me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome ſinne, or els confirme me in ſome good worke begunne in me. Secondly, if in wiſedome we would ſo prouide, that afflictions might not quaile vs when they come; then let vs in the time of proſperitie and quietneſſe of ſoule, cut off all head ſtrong affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as greife, ſorrow, and ſuch like, and then ſhall they not in our trouble preuaile againſt vs. Laſtly, learne to denie our ſelues, and all our owne reaſon: Luk. 9.23. <hi>if any man will come after me, let him denie himſelfe, and take vp his croſſe daily, and follow mee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The laſt thing requiſit in all theſe, is the keeping of a good memorie; yea, though our trouble be paſt, yet ſtill with feare to remember the hand of the Lord. The deliuerance of the children of Iſrael is often repeated in the Scriptures, and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for good endes, becauſe naturally wee <hi>forget the workes of God, and his noble actes of ancient time:</hi> which if they were faithfully treaſured vp, would doe vs much good in our times of need: for either wee muſt thinke that God is not able to helpe vs, or if hee be able, yet wee are vnworthy of his helpe: if wee doubt of his power; ſee what hee did for Iſrael in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> in the <hi>red ſea,</hi> the <hi>wilderneſſe,</hi> and among all their <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:</hi> If wee thinke wee are vnworthy, then ſtill thinke on Iſrael, the worſt people on the face of the earth: for they were alwaies prouoking the holy one of Iſrael. Pſal. 34.5.6. <hi>Yee ſhall looke vnto him, and runne vnto him, and their faces ſhall not be aſhamed, this poore man cried and the Lord heard him, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him out of all his troubles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus much of the efficient cauſes; the matter followes out of which we are to draw ſome ſpeciall comfort. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of affliction is <hi>puniſhment</hi> and <hi>action:</hi> Puniſhment therefore
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:21235:212"/>a <hi>morall</hi> good, action therefore a <hi>poſitiue</hi> good. The morall good, firſt it corrects <hi>ſinne paſt,</hi> by opening our eyes to ſee it, by humbling of vs, and bringing of vs to meditation of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and heauenly things. Secondly, it cures <hi>ſinne preſent,</hi> by croſſing of our nature. Thirdly, it preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts <hi>ſinne to come.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it <hi>tries what is in our hearts.</hi> All this doth a wicked man no good: for the puniſhment is nothing but an execution of gods vengeance vpon them: but to the godly it is a ſchoole-maſter to bring them vnto Chriſt. For the ſecond, the worke of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, though in it ſelfe a poſitiue good, becauſe an action; yet it works but wofully in the vngodly, but moſt comfortably in the children of God: Heb. 12.11. <hi>it brings forth the ſweete and quiet fruit of righteouſneſſe vnto all them that are exerciſed:</hi> for it is a moſt certaine thing in Gods children, that the more their afflictions growe, the more their faith groweth; the more Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than ſtriues to drawe them from God, the more they drawe neere vnto God, although in feeling they ſee not ſo much.</p>
                  <p>The third cauſe is the <hi>forme,</hi> making an eſſentiall difference betwixt the afflictions of the godly, and of the wicked. They are in the godly <hi>corrections of loue</hi> for their good, but in the wicked the <hi>vengeance of God</hi> to their euerlaſting periſhing.</p>
                  <p>The fourth &amp; laſt, is the ende: firſt in regard of Chriſt, Phil. 1.20. to <hi>magnifie him,</hi> and therfore an honour vnto his Saints. Secondly, in regard of our ſelues, 2. Cor. 1.9. <hi>not to truſt in our ſelues:</hi> good to lay aſide vaine confidence. Thirdly, for our vocation, 1. Pet. 2.21. <hi>good to accompliſh the end of our vocation.</hi> Fourthly, good in their owne vſe: all his well that ends well: Ioh. 16.20. <hi>Your ſorrow ſhall be turned into ioy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To proceede to another demonſtration; that afflictions are good and comfortable, may appeare in the fruits of it: which are either within vs, or without vs. The firſt, is called the <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the fleſh,</hi> or the crucifying of the luſts thereof. The ſecond, is called the <hi>mortification of the outward man</hi> by mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold afflictions. To this is required a <hi>good cauſe.</hi> Secondly, <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence voluntarie,</hi> not perforce; not mercinarie, but to ſhew our obedience. Thirdly, <hi>conſtant,</hi> not for a brunt. Fourthly, for a <hi>good end.</hi> Now their is nothing in theſe afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s but ioy: theſe
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:21235:213"/>will neuer gall the conſcience, but make it ſtout and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: therefore let vs ſee the effects of the other. Firſt, it ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the eare: Iob. 33.16. <hi>then he openeth the eares of men euen by their corrections which he hath ſealed.</hi> Secondly, it brings forth <hi>greife,</hi> and is verie neceſſarie to bring on other effects. Greife we know would faine haue eaſe whereof it is, and it labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth alwaies to lay it ſelfe open, and to mooue pitie, it ſeareth nothing more then to be hidden: for which cauſe nature hath giuen more helps to bewray this affection then any other; as heauineſſe of countenance, hanging downe of the forehead, moouing of the eyes, teares, ſighs, and grones: it teacheth elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and maketh vs to change our ſpeeches, and ſo we learne to amplifie the cauſes of our woe: ſo that falling on any obiect of our greife, we are loth to depart from ſpeaking of it: we double our ſpeeches on that theame: we know the matter of Ezekias greife forced his tongue to touch it twiſe, <hi>my tongue, my tongue ſhall praiſe thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When our Sauiour Chriſt ſpake of doctrine, he neuer doubles his words, but is content to vtter it in a word: but when he came to the <hi>rebellion of Ieruſalem,</hi> it touched him ſo neerely that he cryes, <hi>Oh Ieruſalem, Ieruſalem:</hi> and Dauid when he lights vpon his ſonne Abſolon, <hi>O Abſolon, Abſolon, O my ſonne Abſolon.</hi> Thirdly, after greife it makes vs loath and deteſt our ſelues: Iob. 42.6. <hi>therfore I abhorre my ſelfe, and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi> Fourthly, to ſeeke vnto God: Hoſ. 5.15. Pſal. 78.34. <hi>when he ſlew them, they ſought him, and they returned and ſought the Lord early.</hi> Ier. 31.18. <hi>I haue heard Ephraim lamenting thus, Thou haſt corrected mee, and I was chaſtiſed as an vntamed calfe: conuert thou mee, and I ſhall be conuerted: after that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, I repented, and after that I was inſtructed I ſmote vpon my thigh: I was aſhamed, yea euen confounded, becauſe I did beare the reproach of my youth.</hi>
                  </p>

When I vſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come vnto theſe diſtreſſed ſoules, and find them floating vp and downe, and crying, we are drowned in the deepe oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of our ſinnes, and God hath not onely forgotten his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies vnto vs, but remembers that we were made for his wrath: Well, if it be ſo, then forſake God, renounce your faith; yet let me heare, if you dare open your mouthes to ſpeake againſt God, or euer ſuffer a cogitation of ſuch blaſphemie to enter your ſoules: yea if God himſelfe ſhould rap you on the fingers, and ſay, what haue you to doe with my mercies? yet you will not part with your hold; and therefore neuer reſolue of this fearefull apprehenſion, vntill you can reſolue to curſe God, and die for euer; but this you neither can, ſhall, nor will doe.

                  <p> And thus hauing freed the godly from the application of this fearefull ſentence, I bring it to the wicked, and aſſure them, that whatſoeuer fearefull thing they haue heard in all this diſcourſe, it of right belongs vnto them, and whatſoeuer els can be ſaid of the terrors of conſcience: <hi>Oh therefore conſider this, ye that forget God, for this ſhall teare you in peices, and there ſhall be none that can deliuer you.</hi> Alas, of all kinds of miſerie that can befal vnto man, none is ſo lamentable as this, becauſe it riſeth of the ſenſe of Gods wrath, &amp; reuenging hand againſt the guiltie ſoule of a ſinner. Other calamities afflict the bodie, and part onely of our nature: this the ſoule which carrieth the whole into ſocietie of the ſame miſerie. Such as are of the bodie (though they approach nigher the quick then pouertie, or want of neceſſaries for maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this life) yet they faile in degree of miſerie, and come ſhort of that which this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth vpon the ſoule: the other touch thoſe parts where the ſoule commandeth, <hi>pouertie, nakedneſſe, ſickeneſſe,</hi> and other of that kind are mitigated with a minde reſolute in patience, or endued with wiſedome to eaſe that which greiueth, by ſupply of remedie: this ſeazeth vpon the ſeate of wiſedom it ſelfe, and chargeth vpon all the excellencie of vnderſtanding, and grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth into powder all that ſtandeth firme, and melteth like the dewe before the ſunne whatſoeuer we reckon of as ſupport of our defects, and ſubdueth that wherewith all things elſe are of vs ſubdued: The cauſe, the guilt, the puniſhment, the reuenge, and the miniſters of the wrath, all concurring together in more forcible ſort (and that againſt the vniuerſall eſtate of our nature, not for a time but for euer) then in any other calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie whatſoeuer. Here the cauſe is neither <hi>wound or ſurfet, ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke or ſpoile, infamy or diſgrace;</hi> but all kind of miſerie ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, with a troubled ſpirit, feeling the beginnings, and expecting with deſperate feare, the eternall conſummati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the indignation and fierce wrath of Gods vengeance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the violation of his holy commaundements; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it take not away in this life the vſe of outward bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, yet doth the internall anguiſh bereaues vs of all delight of them; and better without them, then in ſuch ſort to enioy
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:21235:215"/>them. This is not liable to humane lawes, and to come vnder the cenſure of earthly iudges but to the diuine lawes of God, and the cenſure executed with her owne hands; which cenſure is a ſeparation from Gods fauour, the creator and bleſſer of all things, the fountaine of all peace and comfort. Now what creature beeing the worke of his owne hands, dare comfort and cheare vs with any conſolation? or what aſſurance of eſcape if wee would flee? the puniſhment hath no miſerie to compare with it, the ſenſe of it paſſeth the capacity of man: for as bleſſednes with God, is aboue all conceit of mans beart, and report of tongue: ſo the contrarie eſtate exceedeth all vnderſtanding of the mind, and vtterance of ſpeach; and is ſuch as is aboue meaſure vnhappy and moſt miſerable, inflicted by Gods reuenge, who is himſelfe a conſuming fire, &amp; whoſe wrath once kindled, burneth to the bottome of hell. Againe, the miniſter of reuenge is without all compaſſion: he will not be content with Iobs riches and poſſeſſions, but he vrgeth <hi>skin for skin;</hi> would haue God permit him to ſtreatch out his hand to touch his bones and fleſh: neither there would he ſatisfie himſelfe, but euen againſt Gods expreſſe commandment, if it were poſſible, bring his life into the duſt: neither there would he reſt, vntill he had brought him to damne both bodie and ſoule. Now if God would but look on, as he did while the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil was beating Iob, it would wonderfully refreſh the wicked, though the Lord meant neuer to helpe them: but alas, hee wil not vouchſafe them the leſt countenance, but ſuffer the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill to torment and racke them to the vttermoſt of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Therefore as he hath mourthered the ſoules of infinite men, he ſhal be praying on them for euer: Oh wofull eſtate!

<pb n="408" facs="tcp:21235:216"/>they be not ſo cruell vnto themſelues; but conſider that euery ſinne they commit, is the ſtabbing and wounding of their conſciences; and he that ſtabbes often the ſelfeſame place, wil be ſure to bring out his heart blood, and make a moſt feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ende: for though the wounds of the conſcience bleeding freſh, are not ſo ſenſible; yet beeing feſtered, and full of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, hauing no oyle of grace powred into them, ſhall bee extraordinarie ſores, and ſo miſerably felt of the patient, that when the Lord ſhall touch them, they ſhall roare, and gnaſh with their teeth, for the extremity of the paine. Secondly, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to the godly, to bee moſt tender for the eie of their conſcience: We vſe the eye of the bodie moſt tenderly, and great is our care to ſafegard it, much more ought wee to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the eye of our ſoule, beeing farre more excellent then the eie of the bodie.</p>

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. Conſolation: firſt, in all diſtreſſe to knowe that it is a happie thing to beare <hi>the yoke in our youthes,</hi> to know our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes betimes, and haue our ſinnes diſcouered; for then is there hope of cure: but if they continue vntill old age, then wil they be in greater danger. Secondly, in all our welfare to labour for the aſſurance of a good conſcience, which is our beſt feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie.</p>

                  <p>Want of conſideration makes men forget God, and both theſe are forerunners of Gods vengeance, and euerlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: therefore the admonition is to all wicked and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe men, that betimes they arraigne themſelues, call a Iurie, try their wayes, and examine their own hearts how they ſtand with God: for it ſeemes their eſtate is verie lamentable. Firſt, in that they are ſtyled forgetters of God, and he that forgets God, cannot but forſake God: Ier. 2.12. <hi>Oh yee heauens, be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtonied at this; be afraid and vtterly confounded, for my people haue commited two euills: they haue forſaken me, the fountaine of liuing
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:21235:216"/>waters, to digge them pits, euen broken pits that can hold no water.</hi> Oh generation, <hi>take heede to the word of the Lord,</hi> conſider in your minds, ponder in your hearts, and obſerue in your waies, whether <hi>the Lord hath bin as a wilderneſſe vnto you; or as a land of darkneſſe?</hi> Oh conſider what a miſcheife you haue procured vnto your ſelues, in that you haue forſaken the Lord your God, which hath <hi>lead you by the way,</hi> and hath bin as a familiar friend vnto you; nay as a prince to command heauen &amp; earth to giue you ſafe-conduct through all the dangers and perills that might befall you: <hi>Can a maid forget her ornament, or a bride her attire?</hi> yet you for whom I haue done all this, <hi>haue forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten me dayes without number.</hi> But if you will not conſider, then aſſure you ſelues, that <hi>your owne wickedneſſe ſhall correct you, and your turnings backe ſhall reprooue you: know therefore and behold, that it is an euill thing, and bitter, that you haue forgotten the Lord your God, and that his feare is not in you:</hi> and if you will not know and behold, then aſſure your ſelues that I <hi>will teare you in peices, and there ſhall be none to deliuer you: though you ſhould waſh your ſelues with nitre, and take much ſope, yet your iniquitie ſhall be marked before mee; ſo that I will neuer forget your tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, but will viſit them vpon you for euer and euer in the place of eaſleſſe and endleſſe torments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For my Saints in whom I delight, <hi>come let vs reaſon together: Though your ſinnes were as crimſin, they ſhall be as white as ſnow: though they were red as ſcarlet, yet ſhall they be as wooll: waſh you</hi> therefore, <hi>make you cleane; take away the euill of your works from before mine eyes, ceaſe to doe euill, learne to doe well, &amp;c.</hi> conſent and obey, that ye may eate the good things of the land: for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it: <hi>he that offereth praiſe ſhall glorifie me, and to him that diſpoſeth his way aright, will I ſhew my ſaluation.</hi> Neither let the ſlanders, reproches, and diſgraces of the world withdraw you from your honeſt conuerſation: for the world is but as a begger, that while the trauailer ſeemes to looke vpon him, cryes nothing but <hi>good your worſhip;</hi> but as ſoone as his back his turned, and the hope of his gain is gone, conuerts his reuerence into railing, his bleſſings into curſes, and good prayers into damnable execrations; but I hope the
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:21235:217"/>honeſt man is neuer the worſe: ſo the world as long as we can ſmile on it, we ſhall haue many good words and kind ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations; but when we giue ouer <hi>to runne into the ſelfeſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of riot with them,</hi> then ſhall we haue them <hi>ſpeake all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of euill of vs:</hi> when the towne is on fire, the bells ring out and make a ſtrange and an vnaccuſtomed iangling, and euery one cryes out to his neighbour for a paile of water to quench the fire withall: ſo if any Chriſtian be fired with a loue of God, and make his houſhold burne in the <hi>feruencie of the ſpirit;</hi> the flame of this fire doth ſo trouble his next neighbour, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery time he heares them at their accuſtomed prayers, or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of pſalmes, he is ſo troubled in mind, and affraid of his owne houſe, that he cannot be quiet vntill he rings all his bels backward-way, and gather together as many as he can with their pailes of water to quench this fire: for alas, as long as he ſees or hears of this fire, he is afraid leaſt the fire of hell ſhould kindle in his conſcience, and ſo depriue him of all his peace and quietnes that he labours to maintaine by his prophaneſſe and wretched liuing: but whoſoeuer thou art that haſt gotten this fire of Gods grace into thine owne houſe, let it burn out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; if it burne thy neighbours houſe, <hi>God ſhall forgiue thee,</hi> &amp; I know no law againſt thee: this I am ſure of, that if to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert one to righteouſnes,</hi> ſhal cauſe a godly man to <hi>ſhine as the ſun in the firmament,</hi> much more if thou conuert a whole houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold: theſe fires are no dangerous fires, and I am afraid, for want of theſe fires, the Lord hath kindled many fires in our land within theſe few yeers: This fire I tell you would not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quench theſe fires among vs, but the fire of ſinne within vs; yea, and that moſt fearfull fire of all the reſt, euen the <hi>fire of hel.</hi> Chriſtians muſt reſerue the top of their affections for God: in other obiects feare exceeds, here no extraſie is high enough: a man of ſpirit, cannot brooke a ſluggard in his worke; and a ſlouth full meſſenger is as <hi>vinegan to the teeth, and ſmoake to the eyes:</hi> ſharpneſſe of wit counts dulneſſe, tediouſnes; now the <hi>Lord is all ſpirit,</hi> and meanes thou to ſerue, and yet not <hi>in ſpirit and truth:</hi> the angels his ſwift meſſengers are flow and cold e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; and therefore thinks thou that God will take pleaſure
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:21235:217"/>in thy drowſieand heauie ſeruice? men chooſe the forwardeſt deere for the game, and the liuelieſt colt for the rod: and therefore thinke not but God delights in the quickeſt and cheerfulleſt ſeruitors at his table: Chriſt ſaies to <hi>Iudas, that which thou doeſt, doe quickely:</hi> and God commanded that the necke of the conſecrated aſſe ſhould be broken, rather then offered vp in ſacrifice: it was rather a curſe then a bleſſing, that Iſſachar ſhould bee a ſtrong aſſe: now an aſſe is the <hi>Hierogli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick</hi> of heauines; &amp; therefore their ſeruice was vnfit for Gods houſe: <hi>Iudah muſt bee as a lyon, that neuer comes without ſpoile;</hi> and ſo muſt all the people be that Shiloh hath gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſince that ſcepter of power and dignitie departed from Iudah. Eliſha the Prophet of the Lord, is called the <hi>horſmen and chariots of Iſrael;</hi> and ſo muſt good Chriſtians be as a fiery chariot, and a readie horſe-man; nay, in the plurall number, horſemen and chariots; too ſtrong and ſwift for all thoſe that ſhall followe them. The <hi>ſluggard, hee cryes a lyon is in the way;</hi> but tell <hi>Sampſon</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> ſo, and they wil out to meete him: Tell a timorous magiſtrate of ſome dangerous oppoſite, and he will ſeeke to pleaſe; yet let <hi>Nehemiah</hi> heare but of a <hi>Samballat,</hi> and he will preſently crie for ſhame, <hi>ſhall ſuch a man as I feare?</hi> Tell <hi>Caleb</hi> of <hi>Anakims,</hi> and he will bee ſo haſtie as that nothing ſhould hold him, <hi>let vs goe vp at once:</hi> Let <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> bind <hi>Paul,</hi> or let him heare that in euerie city bands await him, and he will not long delay their expectation; nay, he is not onely readie for bands, but death too: Tell <hi>Inbentius</hi> hee muſt lay downe his life, and before you haue ſpoken, hee hath laid downe his cloathes: Tell <hi>Luther</hi> of enemies in <hi>Wormes,</hi> and he will go, though all the tiles of their houſes were deuils to pull him in peices. Prou. 30. <hi>Agar</hi> ſpeakes of fowre things ſtately in their kind: Iob. 39.40.41. heares God ſet foorth his maieſtie, by the <hi>horſe,</hi> and <hi>Leuiathan,</hi> &amp;c. to the fowre firſt, I adde a fift, comprehending and excelling them all: namely, the true Chriſtian, ſtrong and bold as a lyon: ſwift as the grey-hound in the wayes of Gods commandements: as nimble as the goate, to climbe the ſteepe and craggie rockes in this world; like Ionathan and his armour bearer that crept vpon
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:21235:218"/>their hands and feete the ſharpe rockes to fight againſt the Philiſtims. Laſtly, victorious Kings to ouercome the world, and his luſts: <hi>Leuiathan laughes at the ſpeare, and the horſe neight at the trumpet:</hi> ſo theſe valiant champions, to take the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, feare neither the noiſe of the world, nor the glittering of the ſpeare; but through fire and water, carrie their liues in their hands, embrace ſtake and faggot; ſay to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother, <hi>I knowe you not:</hi> to carnall counſellers and friendly enemies, <hi>get you behind me Satan:</hi> ſurely if Chriſtians were not ſome admirable perſons, the deuill and the world would not ſo hate them; and except they were extreamely wiſe, they ſhould neuer be counted for ſuch madmen, 2. Cor. 5.13. <hi>Feſtus</hi> makes a mad obiection, <hi>as though much learning ſhould make a man looſe his wit;</hi> but <hi>Paul</hi> makes a ſober anſwer, <hi>Oh noble Feſtus, I ſpeake the words of truth and ſobernes.</hi> Truely a Chriſtian can neuer be in his right wits, till he ſeeme to the world to be beſide himſelfe. But you will ſay, it were well if you could keepe a meane, for that is the golden rule wherein vertue conſiſts: but I anſwer you, it is a meane betwixt two kinds, but not degrees; for vertue is an extreame to vice; and he that cannot be as hote for vertue, as men are for their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is not worthy of her: Take heede I beſeech you, of this philoſophie; for <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> neuer knew any ſo meane vertue, as moſt profeſſors count it now a dayes. But you will ſay againe, ſome diſcretion would do well: I anſwer, ſuch diſcretion as the world likes of, I am ſure will eate vp all zeale; of the two extreames we ſhould moſt feare luke-warmeneſſe; and as one hath ſaid wittily, rather let your milke boyle ouer, then bee rawe.</p>
                  <p>But alas, now the world hath left off reaſoning with Gods people, and are directly fallen to ſcoffing, <hi>young Saints will prooue but old deuills;</hi> theſe hot-ſpurres will ſoone runne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues out of breath, theſe ſingular followes are ſo odde and puritane-like, that they are fit to liue in no ſocietie: yet for all this, may a good Chriſtian ſay, with that which moſt call puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taniſme, I deſire to worſhip God; for what is the fault in theſe men? is it becauſe they haue a delight to heare Gods word,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:21235:218"/>vſe prayer, conference, and other good meanes of their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? no, all theſe they confeſſe are good; but becauſe they are hypocrites: alas God knowes the heart, and therefore go on; for if your hearts be good, euen theſe ſcoffers will they nill they, ſpeake well of you: I am ſure, Chriſt calls for ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritie, and preſſeth and vrgeth it; <hi>what ſingular thing doe yee,</hi> or what odde thing doe yee? ſhall Gods peculiar people doe nothing peculiar? I beleeue none ſhall euer pleaſe Chriſt, till they appeare at oddes with the world; ſtrange and preciſe, and yet for all this need <hi>not be ouer iuſt:</hi> God hath bidden vs <hi>dispoſe our wayes aright;</hi> and the Lord graunt wee may doe it, and then wee ſhall not neede to doubt, but the Lord in his good time will ſhewe vnto vs the perfection of our ſaluation. Amen.</p>
